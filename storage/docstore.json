Identify the courts which must apply the Law of Evidence \n \n \n3.0 LAW  OF EVIDENCE AND APPLICABILITY  \n3.1 What  is Evidence? \n \nIt is worthy of note that there is no statutory definition for the word \u201cEvidence\u201d, \nnotwithstanding this, the definition of the word can be derived from some other ways by \nwhich it is being applied in the day to day\u2019s activities. Evidence as a word can be understood \nfrom the ordinary English usage. On the other hand, according to the Legal writer,  G. Eche \nAda, Evidence can further be understood from both literal perspective and techn ical \nperspective. In the Literal sense, evidence is something which substantiates the existence of \ncertain facts while the technical usage has been ascribed to definition by Blackstone which \nis \u201cthat which demonstrates, makes clear, or ascertains the truth  of the very fact or point in \nissue\u201d.  \n \nEvidence in my own opinion can be said to be a declaration or proclamation made in order \nto establish or prove the existence of certain facts or incidents. Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s \nDictionary defines \u201cEvidence\u201d to m ean information that gives a strong reason for believing \nsomething or prove something. E vidence is the foundation of proof. It is the acceptance \nof the statements or things presented by a person testifying in establishing the \nexistence of certain facts by the Court that occasions a proven fact.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1684, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dba9ca66-01ee-46e6-8160-b3765c05f37d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dba9ca66-01ee-46e6-8160-b3765c05f37d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "838fec22-c7ee-41c6-8d18-37c473f78781", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "50ca1f3ae6db559ef4cf9c4b9e2bd79e3a56be5270bbd4428409e631cb7fb6e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6 \n  \nThe word \u201cE vidence\u201d has been subject of definition and description by several authors \nand for a proper understanding, some of these are hereby examined. Cross defines \nevidence in relation to evidence of fact. He sa ys; \u201cthe evidence of a fact is that which \ntends to prove it - Something which may satisfy an inquirer of the fact\u2019s existence\u201d. On \nhis own part,  Phipson sees  evidence as that which may be placed before the court in order \nthat it may decide issues of fact . Taylor stipulates that Evidence includes the following : \n \n1.   All the classes of evidence \u2013 Such includes oral, documentary or real evidence \n2.   Facts proved \n3.   Facts disproved. \nThe legal author , Aguda, suggest s that Evidence is the means by which facts are proved \nbut excluding inferences and arguments. Taylor defines evidence as: \u201cAll legal means, \nexclusive of mere argument , which  tend to  prove or disprove any matter of fact; the \ntruth of which is submitted to judicial investigation\u201d In his own definition of evidence, \nMcKelvey States: \u201cEvidence is any matter of fact from which an inference may be \ndrawn as to another matter of fact; the former fact is called the evidential fact; the latter, \nthe ultimate, main or principal\u201d. Best also defines evidence as \u201cany matter of fact, the \neffect, tendency or design of which is, to produce  in the mind a persuasion, affirmative \nor dis-affirmative, of the existence, of some other matter of facts\u201d. \n \nWorthy of note on the concept of \u201cEvidence\u201d is what has been expressed by  Best and Nokes \nwho presented the definition from the perspective of the Legal system. B est distinguished \njudicial  evidence as \u201cEvidence received by courts of justice in proof or disproof of facts, \nthe existence of which comes in question before them. Noke s defined Evidence as \u201cJudicial \nevidence consisting of facts which are legally admissible, and the legal means of attempting \nto prove such  facts. \n \nIt is also noteworthy that the definition of the concept \u201cEvidence\u201d has been judicially \nascertained by the Su preme Court in the case of Akintola and Another v.

What therefore is \nevidence? Simply put, it is the means by which any ma tter of fact the truth of \nwhich is submitted to investigation may be established or disproved. \nEvidence is therefore necessary to prove or disprove an issue of fact.  \nEvidence has been said to mean the means by which fact in issue which are material \neviden ce such as oral testimony, documentary evidence or real evidence are established by \na judicial tribunal.  \nThus, from the above assertions, evidence can therefore be summed up to be something or \nthat which is required to prove or disprove an issue of fact.  \n \n3.2 D efinition of Law of evidence \nIn the opinion of Cross and Wilkins, the plaintiff or the prosecution is saddled with the \nresponsibility of proving a great deal of evidence in establishing the facts of their cases and \nit therefore the law of evidence wh ich tells them how they may go about it. Thus implying \nthat the procedures as set out by which facts are proved are regarded as the law of \nevidence.  \n \nThe Law of Evidence relates to the following items : \nI. Proof of facts before the court \nII. Who may prove  \nIII. How facts may be proved, and \nIV. What facts may not be proved in a court of law. \nLaw of Evidence according to S tephen is \u201cthat part of the Law of Procedure  which, with a \nview to ascertain individual rights and liabilities in particular cases, must establish the \nfollow ing: \n(1) What facts may, and what may not be proved in such  cases? \n(2) What sort of evidence must be given of a fact, which may be proved? \n(3) By whom and in what manner the evidence must be produced by which any fact is \nto be pr oved? \n \nHe states that this  part of the Law of Procedure can be found in judicial decisions,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1794, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7cdab5f-4eb5-4573-9a56-a333c5cb591d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7cdab5f-4eb5-4573-9a56-a333c5cb591d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ff8b4da-3600-4fa9-afdb-c3ccc79db6b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "ba396bc5409ce5ad9efd7823a8add05b89c13911f58a442de81c4b3c7d44eb8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "8 \n statute Law and Text- Books, among others. \nIn the line of thought of Hon. Justice P.A. Onamade, Evidence is the means by which any \nmatter of fact, the truth of which is submitted to investiga tion may be established or \ndisproved. It is the means whereby apart from the argument and inference, the court is \ninformed as to the issue of facts as ascertained by the pleading, that is, the testimony, \nwhether oral, documentary or real, which may be lega lly received in order to prove or \ndisprove some facts in dispute.  \n \nIn a succinct form, the law of evidence can be said to involve the application of material \nevidence for proving and establishing facts upon which the claims, charges or defences of \nparties to a suit are based before the law court.   \n \n3.3 Critique of defini tions of Eviden ce. \nIt is worthy of note that though there are several definitions of the concept of Evidence as \ngiven by several writers, all these definitions has been proved to be not all  sufficient despite \nthe fact that all those expressions are nonetheless useful in their different regards.  It is the \nfact of this non sufficiency of each of the definitions that some of them have been subjected  \nto one criticism or the other and these shal l be examined herein accordingly . \n \nAguda States that Evidence does not include \u201cinferences and arguments\u201d But is this \ncorrect? Is \u201cConfession\u201d not Evidence? A \u201cconfession\u2019 suggests \u201can inference\u201d that the \naccused has committed an offence. It is admissible evidence when it is voluntarily made. \n \nTaylors\u2019 definition  is incomplete.  While his definition  includes  methods  of proof, it \nexcludes \u201cactual facts  proved \u201d. It is  silent  on  the  evidence,  which  is  tendered  but \nrejected  which  also  is  evidence.

McKelvey excludes methods \nof proof; He admits only the actual facts proved. \n \nLook at Phipson\u2019s definition; and the use of the conjunction \u201cand\u201d.

What about \n\u201cpresumption\u201d.  A \u201cpresumption\u201d is a conclusion which may or must be drawn until the \ncontrary is proved.   Presumption is part of evidence in law and in fact as we shall see \nlater. \n \nThe Law of Evidence is dynamic; its development has to a large extent been afflicted by a \nnumber of statutory rules and exceptions which do not seem to have any logical \nconnection.   This may tend to make the law of Evidence somewhat difficult. \n \nThe projection of the  Law of Evidence right ly presents  the following qu estions: \n1.   Is the fact or material relevant? \n2.   Is it admissible to prove something that is in controversy? \n3.   Has the correct method of proof been adopted? \n4.   Methods of proof include: \na.   Exercise  of  judicial  discretion  in  relation  to  admissibility  of  a fact  or  \nmaterial  in evidence \nb.   How the judge directs himself in assessing the weight to attach to items of \nevidence.  \nc.   Oral, real and documentary \nThis leads us to the choice of Taylor\u2019s definition (subject to the inadequacy earlier \npointed out). In Taylor\u2019s definition, Evidence covers: \n1.

The procurement of parties\u2019 appearance before the court;  \n2. The ascertainment of the subject of the dispute, that is pleadings;  \n3.

In the ordinary sense, Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary \ndefines fact to be a thing that is known or can be proved to   have happened, to be true or to \nexist. Fact is said to be a thing which is in actual existence.  \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary defines fact to be a thing done; an action performed or an incident \ntranspiring; an event  or circumstance; an actual occurrence; an actual happening in time \nspace or an event menta l or physical; that which has taken place. The Evidence Act 2011 \nunder Section 258 (1) paragraph 9 defines Fact to include - \na) Anything, state of things, or relation of things capable of being perceived by the \nsenses; and  \nb) Any mental condition of which any per son is conscious;  \nThe erudite scholar W.M. Best has given us a clearer picture of what \u2018\u2019fact\u2019\u2019 is by his breaking \ndown of facts into classes and this shall be fully considered because of the importance to our \nline of study. Best subdivides fact into three  types and these include:  \na) Physical or psychological facts  \nb) Events or state of things  \nc) Positive/affirmative and negative facts  \n1. Physical or Psychological Facts : Physical facts are those that are visible to the eye \nwhether animate or inanimate being while Psych ological facts are those which are \nembedded only in animate being, such as the one that exist in the mind of an \nindividual. Such includes the appeal to the senses, the ability to feel, recollect and be \nconscious of happenings.

Event or State of Things : This is the occurrence of events or happenings, it has been \nsaid that this is called \u2018\u2019an act\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019an action\u2019\u2019. The concept of Event infers the \nhappening or incidence around a thing while State of things infers to the actual \nexistence of that thing. This classification has been well illustrated by W. M. Best \nhimself. The illust ration describes the difference between Event and State of Things \nusing \u2018\u2019A Tree\u201d. His analogy is based on the existence of a tree and the falling of that \ntree. He said the existence of a tree is \u2018\u2019A State of Things\u2019\u2019 while the falling of the tree \nis \u2018\u2019Eve nt\u201d. \n3. Positive/Affirmative And Negative Facts : This class has been explained by W.M. Best \nwho said the existence of certain state of things is a positive or affirmative fact while \nits non -existence is a negative fact.  \n3.2.2 Concepts of Fact under the Evidence Act  \nIt is noteworthy that under the Evidence Act, four concepts relating to facts are noted \nand these are: Facts in Issue, Proved facts, Disproved Facts and facts not proved. All \nthese are hereby examined as follows:  \n1. Fact -in-Issue : These are all the facts whi ch the plaintiff/claimant or prosecution and \nthe Defendant or accused must prove to succeed in his or her claim or defence. It is \nonly on the fact -in-issue or facts relevant fact -in-issue that the court ought to make \npronouncement. The plaintiff in civil c ause is expected to substantiate or prove the \nfact -in-issue in order to succeed except in situations where the defendants has \nadmitted such facts. Also in criminal cases, what the prosecution must establish in \norder to secure a conviction must be fact -in-issue. In whichever situation it applies, \nsuch facts must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Facts -in-issue are those facts \nbeen contended and contested by the two parties to an action. A full definition of the \nfacts -in-issue has been given by the interpre tation section of the Evidence Act 2011, \nprecisely Section 258 paragraph 10 where it states as follows:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2182, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a10de4fd-a61d-4a5f-be3a-95507b10500a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a10de4fd-a61d-4a5f-be3a-95507b10500a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00b87e5b-b030-4102-9cd9-07e07ef98d05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "cd1239804bf78c595e46a4bb6f4b6b63f2ac090b8da996c565fb5def9d678a0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "19 \n \u2018\u2019Fact in issue\u2019\u2019 includes any fact from which either by itself or in connection \nwith other facts the existence, non -existence, nature or extent of any right, \nliability or disability asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding necessarily \nfollows.  \nAccording to the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 5th Edition, Facts in issue are defined as those \nmatters of fact on which the plaintiff proceeds by his action, and whi ch the \ndefendant controverts in his defense. Thus by the above assertions, it is necessary to \nestablish that what makes facts to be in issue is the contention attached to it. So if \nthe facts are not being contended, it will not qualify as facts in issue.  \nWhat constitutes facts in issue has been judicially determined in the case of \nOlufosoye v. Olorunfemi (1989) 1 NWLR (Pt 95) pg 26,  where the Supreme Court of \nNigeria held that an admitted fact is not in issue. It is only when facts are in dispute \nthat they are said to be in issue.  \nIt is worthy of note that facts admitted has been decided to be contained in the \npleadings of the parties particularly in civil proceedings.. See the case of Elimare v \nEhonyo (1985) 1 NWLR pt 2 at pg 177,  here the conclusion of the  court was to the \nextent that  admitted facts are usually contained in the pleadings of the party in the \ncivil proceedings. Therefore facts admitted are not in issue as the content is cleared \nand acceptable to all parties.  \n2. Proved Facts : This is enshrined u nder Section 121(a) of the Evidence Act 2011 which \nprovides as follows: A Fact is said to be - \"proved\" when, after considering the matters \nbefore it, the court either believe it to exist or considers its existence so probable that \na prudent man ought . in the circumstances of the particular case . to act upon the \nsupposition that it does exist:  \n \n3.

The court\u2019s decision is based on opinion formed from the facts \npresented and the provision of the law in that regard, i.e, that is relevant to the matter. \nWhile it is expected that the court must know the law, the cour t can only form its \nopinion from facts placed before it.  \nAccording to the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 5th Edition, \u2018\u2019Fact\u2019\u2019 is very frequently used in r \ncontrast with  \u2018\u2019Law\u2019\u2019. It states that questions of facts are for the jury while questions of \nlaw are for the  court. Facts are based on the event of things while law is based on the \nprinciple laid down. Facts are the events of things to be proved upon which the rule of \nlaw is applied. Law is conceived while fact is actual. Law is a rule of duty while fact is that  \nwhich has been according to or in contravention of the rule of law.  \n3.3   Essence of the Rule of Evidence  \nEvidence Rules according to the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 5th edition is the rules which \ngovern the admissibility of evidence at hearings and trials.

These \nproblems have been identified to be four and are discussed as follows:  \n1. Who is saddled with the burden of proving facts? - The Rule of evid ence points out \nthe party who must discharge the burden of proof in a suit. The party who claims or \nassert must of importance be the person to discharge the burden of proof except in \ncertain situations where the burden of proof shifts to the other party li ke in the case \nof the sanity of a person. For example, where someone alleges that another person is \ninsane, it is this person that is  referred to as insane who must discharge the burden \nof proving his sanity. Thus, the party who will lose when certain fact s are not \nestablished must be the one to discharge the burden of proof.  \n2. What facts may be proved? - These facts are those material to the sustenance of a \ncase. They are the material facts which , if not established , will make the party who \nought to depend on  it fail. The only exceptions to these material facts are facts which \nare already admitted in evidence as stated under Section 123 of the Evidence Act \n2011 and facts which the court must take judicial notice of as provided for under \nSection 122 (1), (2), ( 3), and (4).  \nFacts to be judicially noticed include the following:  \na) All laws or enactments and any subsidiary legislation made under them \nhaving the force of law now or previously in force in any part of Nigeria;  \nb) All public Acts or Laws passed or to be pa ssed by the National Assembly or a \nState House of Assembly, as the case may be, and all subsidiary legislation \nmade under them and all local and personal Acts or Laws directed by the \nNational Assembly or a State House Assembly to be judicially noticed:  \nc) The course of proceeding of the N ational Assembly and of the Houses of \nAssembly of the States of Nigeria;  \nd) The assumption of office of the President, a State Governor or Chairman of a \nLocal Government Council. and of any seal used by any such public officer:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2082, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "863ff4ef-7c60-4af1-be48-1e40c96b32c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "863ff4ef-7c60-4af1-be48-1e40c96b32c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d9cf6e0-2ff5-47ee-b2ab-d72c9e0aa0a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "30fd680904d2396b6f871653241d913ef8531361fb8b2d4c6cbecebf85ed3a07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "22 \n e) The seals of all the courts of Nigeria, the seals of notaries public . and all seals \nwhich any person is authorised to use by any Act of the National Assembly or \nother enactment having the force of law in Nigeria;  \nf) The existence, title and national flag of every State or sovereign recognised by \nNigeria:  \ng) The divisions of time, the geographical divisions of the world, the public \nfestivals , and holidays notified in the Federal Gazette or fixed by an Act:  \nh) The territories within the Commonwealth;  \ni) The commencement , continuance and termination of hostilities between the \nFederal Republic of Nigeria and any other State or body of persons:  \nj) The names of the members and officers of the court and of their deputies and \nsubordinate officers and assistants, and also of all o fficers acting in execution \nof its process, and of all legal practitioners and other persons authorised by \nlaw to appear or act before it;  \nk) The rule of the road on land or at sea:  \nl) All general customs, rules and principles which have been held to have the \nforce of law in any court established by or under the Constitution and all \ncustoms which have been duly certified to and recorded in any such court; \nand \nm) The course of proceeding and all rules of practice in force in any court \nestablished by or under the Cons titution.

Fact s in Issue : these are the facts which the plaintiff or prosecution and the \ndefendant or accused must prove to succeed in his claim or defence. They are facts \nnecessary in order to prove or disprov e, to establish or refute a case. These are the \nfacts which by the pleadings of the parties are in dispute.  \nFacts in issue includes any fact from which either by itself or in connection with \nother facts the existence, non -existence, nature or extent of any  right, liability or \ndisability asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding necessarily follows.

Hearsay : Hearsay evidences are the evidence given which project the claim of \nanother person apart from th e person testifying in court. That is to say that the \nperson given the testimony did not personally witness the incidence been testified \nabout but such are given or made available to him/her from someone else who \nclaims the knowledge of such fact.

Primary evidence are those termed to be the best as there is no other \nbetter than it while secondary evidence is that which suggests that there is a better \nevidence other than itself. Original documents are primary evidence and  have \noverriding effect above other types of evidence while the copy of such evidence is \nsecondary evidence of its content. See Section 85 -87 of the Evidence Act 2011  \nb) Direct or Testimonial Evidence : This is said to be applicable in two ways; either as \nthe direct evidence as testimony made by a witness in the law court and as \nstatement of witness based on perception of the fact in issue or relevant facts. But \nthis evidence is rather used in the first way as it refers to the direct evidence of a \nwitness who s aw the occurrence of an incidence.  \nc) Circumstantial Evidence : This deals with the type of evidence in which the fact in \nissue may be inferred from a given situation or occurrence. This kind of evidence is \nonly made applicable when there is the absence of dir ect evidence. This assertion has \nbeen subject of judicial decision in the case of Udo -debia & others v. The State \n[1976] 11 S.C. 133 , where the Supreme Court held as follows:  \nWhere direct testimony of eye -witness is not available, the court is \npermitted t o infer from the facts proved, the existence of other facts \nthat may be logically inferred.  \nCircumstantial evidence is one which projects a number of circumstances in which \ninference can be made of the occurrence of a situation, thus becoming the facts \nupon which the case rests. Example of such situation came up in  the case of Francis \nIdika Kalu v. The State [1993] 7 S.C.N.J. (Part I) 113.  Here the accused and the \ndeceased were the only persons in a room. The deceased was found dead with his \nthroat cut and the accused was found standing with a blood -stained machete in his \nhand beside the corpse. Even though there was no direct evidence, the Supreme \nCourt upheld the conviction of the appellant on the ground that from the \nsurrounding circumstances, \u2018\u2019the evide nce adduced cogently, irresistibly and un -\nmistakenly pointed to the appellant as the murderer\u2019\u2019.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2260, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21283e36-8cc6-41cc-a395-7456f64831ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "21283e36-8cc6-41cc-a395-7456f64831ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80c31dfe-7943-42f7-b51b-d34f011f7223", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "8dc724319720ad258e21f4dd86a76f5e578925d1b30b8987c5109976cb6d7316", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "31 \n It is worthy of note that for a circumstantial evidence to be relied on, it must be that \nwhich is cogent, unequivocal, strong and compelling and must lead to t he irresistible \nconclusion that the accused and no other person committed the offence, such \nevidence must make no room for any reasonable doubt.  \nd) Insufficient, prima facie and conclusive Evidence : Insufficient evidence  is that which \nis not adequate to lend a support to the case of the party giving it,  thus, making it \nunappealing to a reasonable man to make it the basis of a judgement. Example of \nsuch situation is the case of Uche and Nwosu v. The Queen [1964] 1 All N.L.R. 195 . In \nthis case, the only evidence  against the second Appellant in a case of robbery was \nthat he was seen entering the same bus with the first Appellant who had \noverwhelming evidence against him for the commission of the offence. It was held \nthat the conviction of the second Appellant was not valid as the evidence against him \nwas insufficient.  \nWhen a case is undefended, evidence adduced in support of the case, may be held to \nbe insufficient by the court.  \nPrima facie evidence  on its own part is that which would entitle a party to a \njudgeme nt in his favour unless such evidence is contradicted.

When a prima facie evidence is established by a party, it shifts the burd en \nof proof to the other party and in the absence of any or further evidence to the \ncontrary, the prima facie evidence becomes a conclusive proof. This term is normally \ninvoked at a stage of a no \u2018\u2019case submission\u2019\u2019 in a criminal trial. In a criminal case,  a \nprima facie evidence is established when the prosecution has presented sufficient \nevidence to render reasonable a conclusion on the face of the evidence that the \naccused is convictable in the absence of a contrary evidence.  \nA prima facie evidence has be en described as not synonymous with conclusive or \nsufficient proof, it is the evidence which on the face of it is sufficient to sustain the \ncharge preferred against the accused.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2176, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5e049fe-22ab-4b1f-b306-13c125434f17": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5e049fe-22ab-4b1f-b306-13c125434f17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b717a25-09a5-401c-b650-9a4014871a6c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "7ecc2eba30e86c569e7d1433b6be4c1172ac79dbff3d5b72876e413284fdd1c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "32 \n Conclusive evidence  is that evidence which cannot be contradicted. An example  of \nthis is the criminal culpability of a child under seven years of age under the Section 50 \n(a) of the Penal Code which provides that: \u2018\u2019No act is an offence\u2019\u2019 if it done \u2018\u2019by a child \nunder seven years of age\u2019\u2019.

Appearance of a person : This entails the procurement of a person\u2019s physical \nappearance in court for the purpose of establishing certain facts like injury \nsustained, claim on pat ernity of a child or the determination of the age of a \nchild.  \niii. Demeanour of Witnesses : This deals with the character of a witness either \nwithin or without the court. The behaviour of a witness observed as to \ntruthfulness, deceitfulness vengeful or otherwise  could be used as evidence \nbefore the court and this constitutes real evidence.  \niv. View:  This deals with the inspection of the place of occurrence of an event \nupon which a case is established. This in law is what is referred to the visit to \nthe \u2018\u2019locus in quo \u2019\u2019. Locus in quo is the scene of a crime or where an act been \ndisputed occurred.  \nv.

Documents : This involves the usage of a document in evidence as a chattel \nand not for the purpose of the perusal of its content. Example of this is the \npresentation of an alleged st olen book that is recovered and now presented \nin court as evidence.  \nTake note that the above treated classifications according to Eche Adah has been duly \ncriticised by C.C. Nweze on the ground that it is not co -extensive with the main division of \njudicial evidence given under the Evidence Act. He said the classifications cannot be correct \nas it will only fit as a sub classification of certain evidence like documentary evidence. He \nfurther argued that the classification of Adah which project insufficient, pr ima facie and \nconclusive evidence is not accurate as they are mere terminologies employed in relation to \nthe burden of proof.  \nThe criticism of Nweze is rather out of place in all ramification giving regards to the fact that \nAdah never said that the classif ications are based on the express provisions of the Evidence \nAct. Thus it is a classification based on a voyage of academic pursuit for the purpose of easy \nidentification of necessary concepts under the law of evidence.  \nFurthermore, Nweze agreed that Adah\u2019 s classification could fit into a sub division of \ndocumentary evidence that therefore means that such classifications are not in any way out \nof place if it can still be deemed to be somehow relevant. It is my candid opinion that the \nattempt to classify jud icial evidence according to the express provision of the Evidence Act \nshould not in any way invalidate Adah\u2019s definition which has been able to project a good \nacademic understanding of the different types of judicial evidence. Adah\u2019s definition does \nnot in  any way preclude the given of any other classification as may be deemed necessary \nlike the one given under the Evidence Act.  \nHaving therefore examined the classifications of judicial evidence according to legal writers, \nit will be necessary for us to exam ine the classification of judicial evidence in accordance \nwith the express provision of the Evidence Act. The classification of Judicial Evidence under \nthe Evidence Act is traditional three types which include: Oral Evidence, Evidence of \nMaterial Things/Re al Evidence and Documentary Evidence , but the Evidence Act 2011 \nseems to have added an extra classification which is Electronic  Evidence .

Oral Evidence : This is the testimony given in person by a witness before a law court. \nIt is the presentation of evidence by word of mouth while testifying in the witness \nbox. The witness is normally put on oath or allowed to affirm based on his/her \nreligious belief before proceeding to give evidence. Oral evidenc e of facts is expected \nto be given in a trial. See Section 125 of the Evidence Act 2011 provides that \u2018\u2019All \nfacts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence\u2019\u2019.  \nNevertheless it is noteworthy that the meaning of oral evidence has been expanded \nby the Evidence Act by virtue of its provision for written evidence for those witnesses \nwith speech challenges. This therefore qualifies the literal meaning of oral evidence \nas the evidence given by such with speech disability is deemed to be oral  evidence by \nthe Act. Section 176 (1) and (2) provides as follows:  \n1. A witness who is unable to speak may give his evidence in any other \nmanner in which he can make it intelligible, as by writing or by signs: \nbut such writing must be written and the signs ma de ill open court.  \n2. Evidence so given shall be deemed to be oral evidence  \nOral evidence in a proceeding is very important to the court because it allows the \ncourt to take certain facts surrounding the witness composure at trial into \nconsideration in formin g its opinion about the authenticity and truthfulness of the \nevidence being given by the witness. During the different stages of examination of \nwitness, i.e. Examination in Chief, Cross Examination and Re -Examination, the \ntestimony of the witness is being vividly observed in other to determine the accuracy \nof the evidence been given by the witness.  \nB. Evidence of Material Things/Real Evidence : This kind of evidence has been described \nto be objective or demonstrative evidence derived by the court from the inspe ction \nof physical objects other than documents which could be a place, a person, animal or \nthing.

Documentary Evidence : This kind of evidence deals with the production of \ndocuments in a judicial  proceeding for the purpose of proving its content. According \nto Hon. Justice P.A. Onamade, Documentary evidence is of tremendous importance \nin court proceeding. To him, Documentary Evidence forms part of the entire gamut of \nthe Law of Evidence. It is the yardstick by which the veracity of oral testimony is \ntested. The importance of documentary evidence is well enunciated in the dictum of \nLord Mcnaghten when he asserted in Hennessey v. Keating (1908) 421 L.T.R. 169  \nthat the eye is no doubt the best test. Th is therefore implies that what the eyes of \nthe court see via documents tendered in trial helps the formation of better opinion \non the matter.  \nDocumentary evidence simply put will qualify for the usage of documents in giving \nevidence in a proceeding . The ki nds of documents which are regarded under the law \nare provided for under Section 258(1) of the Evidence Act 2011.

This \ntherefore will lead us into considering the classification of law by legal writers.  \n \n3.1 Classification of Law  \nLaw is that which is laid down, ordai ned or established. It is a rule or method according to \nwhich phenomena or actions co -exist or follow each other. It can be a rule of action within a \ngiven society. The full understanding of the concept of law can be derived from its \nclassification most es pecially in relation to practical application of its principles.  \nAccording to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th edition, classification means arrangement into \ngroups or categories on the established criteria. This can have two meanings, one primarily \nsignifying a division required by statutes, fundamental and substantial, and the other \nsecondary, signifying an arrangement or enumeration adopted for convenience only.  \n \nClassifications are given for ease of reference and clarity of intent and content, thus the need \nto give the classification of law by legal writers. For a proper understanding of the concept of \n\u2018\u2019Law\u2019\u2019, L egal writers have given a clear division of it  into two branches which are :  (a) \nSubstantive and (b) Adjectival or Adjective Law.  \n \na.   Subs tantive Law \nThis branch of law is one that defines rights, duties and liabilities of parties to a \ntransaction in issue. It is simply referred to as the basic law of rights and duties. It  is a \ngeneric term, which covers such areas of law as tort, contract, crime, etc. It is the \nlaw that defines legal rights, duties and liabilities.  Examples are of these are : The \nCriminal Code and The Penal code. \n \nb. Adjectival  Law \nThis is also referred to as the law of procedures or law of practice.  Th is b ran ch  of \nlaw govern s th e ma ch in ery b y which  su b st ant ive law is lifted from the \nstatute book and administered  in practice. It regulates the manner  and style by which \na judicial proceeding is carried out and it deals with the establishment of facts upon \nwhich rights, duties, and liabilities are founded in a judicial proceeding .

Examples of this branch of law are; Criminal Procedure \nCode, Criminal Procedure Act an d Evidence Act. \n \nIt is worthy of acknowledgement that adjectival law deals with procedure and evidence. \nThis term \u2018\u2019procedure\u2019\u2019 is often used to embrace evidence, especially in proceedings where \nevidence is required.  \n \n3.2 Theories of Sources of Law \nWe cann ot properly consider the sources of law of evidence without first understanding the \nsources of law itself. It is therefore in this light that the sources of law will be based on the \ntheories of the sources of law. T he theories of Sources of Law have been e xplained to \ninclude:  the Consensus theory,  the Conflict theory  and t h e  Middle-of-the-Road theory . \nThese are hereby discussed as follows:  \na. Consensus theory  \nThis theory argues that Laws are a product of unanimous agreement \u2013 a consensus ad \nidem \u2013 of the socie ty. This idea functions as an integrated structure, which the members \nof the pertinent society mutually and voluntarily agree to and accept as their norms, \nrules, and values, which should be uniformly respected.  \nb. Conflict Theory  \nThe conflict theory is in di ssonance with the Consensus theories.  It denies that the \nsociety is ever consensual, but conflict and competitive.   Accordingly, conflict theory \nargues that laws are a dictate of the wealthy and powerful elite, and they make laws only \nto perpetuate their  positions and class interests.   \nc. Middle -of-the Road Course Theory  \nThe proponents of the Middle Course theory argue that the laws are definitions by the \nprivileged group, of the dominant values, notions and morals. The better view is that the \nLaws are the h andiwork of the legislators who are your elected representatives. They \nexercise the political and legal powers of the state but not necessarily to protect their \npositions, statues or class interests  \nIt is worthy of note that none of the theories is complet ely valid or wholly invalid.  Each has \nits merit and deficiencies. The same conclusion is true of any legal system in any part of the \nworld.  \n3.3 SOURCES OF LAW OF EVIDENCE \nLaw of Evidence is a type of  the Public Law, like  the Criminal Law, Constitutional Law,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2322, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c22f18f-15b9-4540-8670-acfce9e705d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c22f18f-15b9-4540-8670-acfce9e705d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ece9be0a-b2fe-4d72-8c4a-048b300c7c3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "ea353fbf70eddfbe39f05a79b55b153d1661546726a1eba645ff5c5dd1a7fe9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "42 \n Administrative Law and Revenue Law.

This period particularly witnessed a lot of legislative activism by the Nigerian \nlegislators though not much difference has been made to the Evidence law as received in \nrelation to the content but the efforts hav e been nonetheless commendable.  \nBoth the Independent Constitution of 1960 and the Republican Constitution of 1963 vested \nthe power to legislate on residual matters of the Constitution which includes the law of \nevidence on the Regional Government.

Firstly, it implies that evidence that \nshall be deemed ad missible under other legislations in Nigeria shall not be deemed \nadmissible and secondly, it implies that where the Evidence Act is silent or deficient on any \nissue, recourse will be made to the law prevailing before the Act, such as the Common Law. \nThis a ssertion has be en judicially determined in the Supreme Court case of R v.

They \ncontained little about rules of evidence.  The reason was that early Judges resented such \nrules.  Even Lord Mansfield in Lowe v. Jollifee (1762)  was heard t o say:  \n\u201cWe don\u2019t now sit here to take our rules of evidence from Siderfin and \nKeble\u201d  \nAt the close of the 18th Century, however, private reporting had grown enormously and \nthere was a gradual decline in resenting \u201crules of evidence from Siderfin  and Kebl e\u201d (with \napology to Lord Mansfield). Case Law and the rules of evidence began to acquire \nprominence. Soon there was a conscious and deliberate effort to codify the common law \nrules of evidence in the form of a digest.  An example is Sir James Fitzergerald Stephen\u2019s \nDigest of Law of Evidence. Sir Stephen\u2019s vision was to codify the common law for the use of \nEnglish Courts, but the British Parliament rejected it and refused to adopt it.  Rather the \nParliament adopted and constituted the  Digest  into  the  Ind ian  Law  of  Evidence,  1872  \nand  subsequently  adopted  it  as  Law  of Evidence for Pakistan, Sri - Lanka, Kenya, Tanzania \nand Uganda.  \n3.2  Statutes:  \nAccording to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, statute is referred to as an act of the \nLegislature d eclaring, commanding, or prohibiting something. It is a particular law enacted \nand established by the will of the legislative department of government. A statute may also \nmean a single act of a legislature or a body of acts which are collected and arranged  \naccording to a scheme or for a session of a legislature department.   \nNigerian Laws are referred to as Nigerian Statutes and some of them also contain some rules \nof evidence which are nonetheless applicable and acceptable to be used in any judicial \nprocee ding which relates to its coverage areas.

The general \nopinion is that the Common  Law applies.  Most of the High Court Rules expressly  \nprovide  for the application of the common law to fill the gap. There are a host of cases in \nwhich this issue has been laid to rest a nd these are as examined below:  \n \nIn the case of R  v Agaragariga  Itule (1961) 1 ANLR 462 the court held that where the matter \nwas not dealt with expressly by the Law of Evidence  the common law will be applied. \n \nIn the case of R  v Agwuna (1949) 12 WACA 456 a t 458  it was held that there is no provision \nin the Act which allows evidence to be rejected save as provided in the Act itself. \n \n4.0.  CONCLUSION  \nThe Constitution of Nigeria, 1960 and 1963 were silent on law of Evidence. The result was a \nmultiplicity of Law of Evidence \u2013 regional and federal.

The Regions and \nthe Central Governments legislated  on \u201cany matters; that  is incidental or supplementary \nmatters \u201d.  The Regions also Legislated on \u201cany matter that is not included in the \nExclusive legislature List e.g. Law of Evidence.  In the 1 979, 1999 and 2011 \nConstitution, \u201cEvidence\u201d became item 23 in the Exclusive Legislative List.

Nwadialo on his own part  classified Evidence into: Direct and \nCircumstantial Evidence, Direct and hearsay Evidence, Oral and Documentary, Real \nEvidence and Primary and Secondary Evidence. \n \nNo one part icular classification is better than the other.  In a conflict situation, it is \nincumbent that one must, (whether consciously or not,) determine the nature of evidence, \nwhether or not the piece of evidence belongs to any of the categories classified.   From \nthere, it is possibl e to proceed further to determine rules of law which  should be applied \nto the case.  The important thing therefore is that each type of evidence should be \nidentified and understood. \n \nFrom the various classifications mentioned  above we have been able to mak e a list of the \ntypes of evidence we have and these include: Direct, Circumstantial, Primary, Secondary, \nInsufficient, Prima facie, Conclusive, Hearsay, Oral, Documentary, Real, Original, Indirect, \nPersonal, Pre-appointed, Causal and B est Evidence. All the se are briefly examined as \nfollows:  \n1) Direct Evidence: Your evidence is direct if it is based on your personal knowledge \nor observation and if true to believed, proves a fact out of inference  or \npresumptions.  It a testimony of what  you hear with your ears, what  you see with \nyour eyes, what you smell with your nose, what you touch with your hand or body \nand what you taste with your mouth or tongue.

Salmon describes it as \u201canything which is believed for any other \nreason than that someone have said so, is believed on real evidence\u201d. Real \nevidence consists of production of any object used in committing a crime, e.g. gun, \nknife, pen. \n12) Original Evidence: This is direct  or best evidence.  It is a witness\u2019s statement that \nhe or she perceived a fact in issue  by hearing, seeing, smelling, touching or tasting \nor that the witness was in a particular physical or mental state. \n \n13) Personal Evidence: This is the evidence which a competent witness under oath or \naffirmation gives a trial or in an affidavit or deposition. \n \n14) Pre-appointed Evidence: Pre -appointed  evidence is pre-constitutional evidence, \nprescribed or procured advance for the proof of certain facts. Example is the \ntestimony of a witness who had hidden in cupboard to hear the conversation of \nother.  By operation of the law, there must be two witnesses to the execution of a \nwill.  Evidence that is not pre-appointed or pre-constituted is causal evidence. \n \n15) Best Evidence Rule: In best evidence rule is that which the nature of the thing will \nafford.  It is evidence which is more specific and definite as opposed to that, which \nis merely general and indefinite or descriptive.   The best evidence is that kind of \nproof, which under any possible circumstances affords the greatest certainty of the \nfacts in question or evidence which comes on its surface, no suggestion of better \nevidence behind.

It is the pr ocess  of \npresenting  testimony , documents, or tangible objects that tend to prove or dispose the \nexistence of an alleged fact or by direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. \n \nJohn Wigmore has rightly asserted that  there is no disputed case that will ordinarily be \nproved solely by circumstantial or solely by direct evidence.  Ordinarily, there is evidence of \nboth kinds. \n \n3.2 Direct Evidence \nDirect  evidence is a statement of personal knowledge or observations, which tends to \nprove a fact without inference or presumption.  The word \u201cdirect\u201d relates to the source of \nknowledge being disposed to.   Direct  evidence is the testimony of a witness who \nperceived the fact in dispute with one of his/her own senses, or the production of the \ndocument which constitutes the fact. \n \nYour evidence is \u2018direct\u2019 if it is a testimony of a fact which you perceive with one of your \nsenses such as hearing, sight, smell, touch or taste.  That is to say it is the testimony as to \nthe perception of a fact in issue. See Section 126, Evidence Act 2011 . It provides as follows:  \n \n126.

Where d irect  testimony  of  \neye  witnesses  is  not available, the court is permitted to infer from the facts proved, the \nexistence of other facts that may be logically inferred.  Where it is available, direct \nevidence is the best evidence. \n \n3.3 Circumstantial Evidence \nCircumstantial evidence is an indirect evidence. This is the evidence other than a direct \nevidence.  When the evidence available does not consist of the fact in issue  but of \nevidential facts, such evidence is circumstantial.   It is neither evidence of the fact in \nissue nor a detailed account of what happened.  It is evidence of a number of items \npointing to the same direction. This is the evidence  of  other  facts  from  which  the  fact  \nin dispute  can  be  inferred,  either  directly  or indirectly with more or less certainty.

This is original and \ndirect. It is better than indirect or circumstantial, like Fatima who gave a narration of what \nDike told her that she (Dike) saw. \n \nBest Evidence is the P roduction of original document e.g.  The Will is primary which is \nbetter  than oral testimony of its contents or secondary evidence of Dambaba who had \nseen and read it. \n \nConversely, proof of admission of the contents of a document of the party against whom \nit is sought to be tendered is a primary evidence. \n \nIf there be two or more ways of proving a fact, the method most cogent, than others  is to \nbe adopted.

This therefore means that a lot of responsibility is placed on the court because it is \nalways a very difficult task for one to draw what is expected to be the fact from a matter \npainted from  different perspectives.  \n \nFrom this juncture I will like to present \u2018\u2019Fact\u2019\u2019 in two divisions which are fact in reality \ncontext and fact in practise context.  \n \nAn example of facts as reality or truth  includes t he following.  \na. \u201cAll men and Women are mortal\u201d  \nb. \u2018\u2019All humans have head\u2019\u2019", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1886, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05b98924-3863-4258-9a0a-396f7ef60d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "05b98924-3863-4258-9a0a-396f7ef60d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2228df4f-9574-4847-8386-c300f8d8c8b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "0a0c7cb3cdee5d7d1ddbfeb58b1a0b64e50285c2ec74e24c4dd36bb5603f5492", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "92 \n EXAMPL ES OF FACT SCENARIO IN PRACTISE  \nAt this juncture, it will be needful to actually examine events that can be examined as a fact \nof a given case.   \n1.

It states that \"fact in issue\" \nincludes any fact from which either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, \nnon-existence, nature or extent of any right, liability or disability asserted or denied in any \nsuit or proceeding necessarily follows. Blacks\u2019 Law Dictionary, 5th edition defines \u2018\u2019Fact in \nIssue\u2019\u2019 as those matters of fact on which the plaintiff proceeds by his  action, and which the \nDefendant controverts in his defense. Thus, controversial matters which all the parties to a \nsuit contest can be said to be the fact in issue. Facts in dispute and to be determined are \nthe facts in issue.  \n \nThis is the fact that the plaintiff, (or claimant) or prosecutor alleges which the defendant \nor accused person controverts.   In other words \u2018facts in issue\u2019 are those facts which the \nparty on whom lies the burden of proof must prove to establish his or her claim or facts \nwhich the other party must prove to establish his or her defence BUT which are not \nadmitted by the other party. \n \nJudicial interpretation has been given to this concept in the case of Olufosoye v. Oluremi \n(1989) 1 NWLR (pt 95) pg 26 . Here the Supreme  Court held that  an admitted fact is not in \nissue.

In a majority of cases, it \nis matter of inferences to be drawn by the judges or Magistrates either as a matter of law \nor as a matter of fact.

Allen and Guest on their own part \nhave added that, \u2018\u2019Evidence  is  probative  of  a  proposition  of  a  proposition  if  it  tends  \nto  show  that proposition to be true, evidence is disprobative if it tends to show that \nproposition to be false\u2019\u2019.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2002, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e80545-649d-4d2d-b8a7-ff134700ebcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e80545-649d-4d2d-b8a7-ff134700ebcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a06d162-af3b-4e80-b435-e1cdc455ad97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "6d54ae1b404d59313f8b2c76cb5ce59a97c0b38db644780afc09c23b88f5368c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "96 \n The Evidence Act 2011 describes facts which are relevant as follows:  \n1.

When the conduct  of any person  is relevant,  any  \nstatement  made  to  him  or  in  his  presence  and  hearings  which  affects  such conduct is \nalso relevant. \n \nActivity \nUchena is charged with the murder of Sophia by poisoning. \nConsider the relevancy and admissibility of the following items of evidence, with reasons:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2074, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e57af576-1e13-444d-b0b7-0bae0c02f9b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e57af576-1e13-444d-b0b7-0bae0c02f9b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86a56fad-c113-4b3f-bfd4-126421465ba5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "5948a08aaaefebf6070bf8e586e5e92ddd3e9bb6a6614b92aea25d426edeb794", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "99 \n 1.

Here Lord Tomlin described res gestae as \u2018\u2019a phrase adopted to \nprovide a respectable cloak for a variety of cause to which no formula of precision can be \napplied\u2019\u2019.  \n \nThe Evidence Law permits the court to admit words and statements about res gestae.  \nThis res gestae embraces not only the actual facts of the transaction and the \ncircumstances surrounding it but also the matters immediately antecedent to and having \na direct causal connection with it; as well as acts immediately following it and so closely \nconnected with it as to form in reality a part of the occurrence. \nIn a criminal proceeding, all acts done by the accused  or by any person in his presence or \nacting under his directions and all statements, oral or written , made by him or by a \nperson in his presence  at the time  of the transaction  or before  or after it,  will be \nrelevant  if they can be shown to be connected with the specific transaction with which  \nthe accused is charged . .  \n \nThe Evidence Act did not use the term \u2018res gesta or res gestae\u2019.

Bedinfield (1879) \n14 Cox C.C. 341 . In this case the accused was charged with the murder of a woman. The \nwoman rushed out of a  house with a cut throat where she and the accused had been \ntogether and exclaimed: \u2018\u2019Oh, aunt, see what Harry has done to me!\u201d. This statement was \nheld inadmissible as it was something stated by her after the event was over. Had the \nstatement been uttered  by her as at the time of the event, it would have been held \nadmissible.  \n \n A similar occurrence like that of the above case is that of the case of R v. Bang Weyeku \n(1943) 9 WACA 195 . In this case the accused was charged with murder and the only \nimportant e vidence against him was the statement of the deceased shortly after he had \nbeen stabbed.

The statements made \nmust be practicably contemporaneous with the act in question but a bit relaxed in Civil \nmatter.  Because transactions in civil matters are long drawn, the requirement of \ncontemporaneity is less strict than in criminal matters.

In  \nan  action  for Negligence by H\u2019s widow, it was held that this statement was admissible as \nforming part of res gestae to support an inference that H had been guilty of some \nnegligence misconduct. \n \nIn R. v Hunt, exclamations of those present at the meeting and the inscriptions on the \nflags and banners displayed, were admitted to prove that an assembly was unlawful and \nseditious. Sometimes the central transaction is referred to as res gestae while the \nconstituent or accompanying facts are regarded as \u201cparts of the Res Gestae.

Here the Plaintiff sued the Defendant \ncompany for negligenc e arising out of a collision by the Defendant\u2019s tram in which the \nplaintiff was injured.

But \nthere judicial authorizes of statements made by non-actors and non-victims that have been \nadmitted as part of the gestae. The authority of this principle has been derived from the \ncase of Howe v Malkin (1878) 40 L T. 196 . In this case a statement made by a person \nconcerning the boundaries of property contemporane ously with the performance of some \nact on the land by some other persons was held inadmissible because the declaration was \nby one person and the accompany act was performed by another person.  \n \nBut it is worthy of note that this cannot be taken as a genera l position of law because in \ncriminal cases declarations by victims and by assailants are often received in evidence under \nthis heading.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2406, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1683c5cd-8d26-486a-bf7f-3c32ccc7464f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1683c5cd-8d26-486a-bf7f-3c32ccc7464f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aea7d9ec-a957-49b6-bf98-ea4479f3d051", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\LAW OF EVIDENCE 1-.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1812469, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "3aa8c273de089074c62b0debf82cde2acfb57707a5e11fd59bc9656efd125191", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "114 \n The rationale for admissibility of these statements and declarations in evidence may be \nexplained on the ground that; \n. human utterance is both a fact and a means of communication, and \n. human action may be so interwoven with words that the disassociation of the words \nform the action would impede the discovery of the truth: per Lord Normand  in Tepper v R \n(1952). \n \n3.3  Res Gesta: Common Law and Evidence Act. \nRes gestae is a common law doctrine and it has consequently been argued that it is not \ndirectly applicable under the Evidence Act. \n \nAt  common  law,  res  gestae  are  statements  and declarations (oral  or \nwritten) made  contemporaneously and tend to accompany or explain a fact in issue  or \nrelevant fact.  There is tendency to  misconstrue contemporaneity  as synonymous with  \nfacts occurring at the same time and place.  The requirement of contemporaneity may \nbe strict in criminal law but it is less so in civil matters. \n \nSection 4 Evidence Act, 2011  permits the court to admit facts which form part of the same \ntransaction whether they occur at the same time and place or at different times and \nplaces.  The phrase \u2018at the same time and place\u2019 answers the description of \ncontemporaneity.  The other phrase \u201cor at different  times  and places\u201d  permits  the  \nadmission  of facts  which  may not  be  substantially contemporaneous as res gestae.    \n \n4.0 CONCLUSION  \n \nRes gestae (thing done) are the event in issue, constituent and accompanying facts \nwhich tend to explain  the  event  or f act  in issu e . To  be  admissible,  it  must  be  \ncontemporaneous, accompany  and explain  the event they accompany  and perhaps  \nalso made by the actor or victim.

Complaint in Sexual Offences. \nIn the early times, there was the requirement that before a person could be convicted of \nrape, there must be evidence that the prosecutrix raised a \u201chue and cry\u201d.  In modern \ntimes what is required is no longer hue and cry but evidence of a complaint.  This applies \nin cases of sexual assault, e.g. Rape, indecent assault and similar offences on females \nand, indecent assault on and indecency with young males. \n \nSince  the  close  of  the  19th   Century,  the  Court  began  to  emphasize  that  the  words  \nof  the complaint are not to be accepted as evidence of the facts stated.  The purpose of \nadmitting the complaint is merely to prove \u201cconsistency of the conduct  of the \nprosecution with the story told by her in the witness box, and as being inconsistent with \nher consent to that of which she complains. \n \nIn an old case of R v Lillyman(1896) the court had the opportunity to consider earlier \nauthorities on  complaint  in  rape  and  other  kindred  offences  against  women  and  \nchildren  (including indecent assault and s exual intercourse with girls under thirteen and \nbetween thirteen and sixteen).   It then came to this conclusion that  the fact that a \ncomplaint was made  by the prosecutrix shortly after the alleged occur rence and the \nparticular of such complaints may so far as they relate to the charge against the prisoner \nbe given in evidence by the prosecution. According to the court such evidence of \ncomplaints is not evidence of the facts complained of but evidence of the consistency of \nthe conduct of the prosecution with the story told by her in the witness box and as \nnegative consent on her part.  The admissibility depends, however, on proof of the facts \nby sworn or other legalized testimony. \n \n3.3.  Criteria for Admissibility of Recent Complaint. To be admissible in evidence, the \ncomplaint must: \n1. Be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity after the assault is committed.  It \nmay not necessarily be made at the very first opportunity.   It may be made as \nsoon as the child could speak to its mother.  In R v Cummings (1948), a land \n|Army girl was raped.

The questions put to the victim merely sought the reasons for her \nsudden decision to go home and did not in any way prompt the victim to say  that \nshe had been assaulted.  The court and that evidence of fresh complaint is \nadmissible \u201cwhether non-consent is legally necessary part of the issue or whether \non the other hand, it is what may be called a collateral issue of fact\u201d in \nconsequence of story told by the complainant in the witness box and the \ncomplaint is not admissible merely as negativing consent but as being consistent \nwith sworn evidence of the complainant. \n \n \n3.3.1  Scope of Application of the Rule of Complaint \n \nIn R.v Camelleri (1922), a boy had complained to his parents of an indecent assault \nmade on him.  The evidence by his parents of the complaint was allowed at the \ncriminal trial.   The Rules of complaint are available irrespective of gender. \n \n3.3.2  The Rules of complaints probably also apply to: \n-  Complaints  of cruelty in the matrimonial causes matters.

A fact is not proved if it is neither proved nor disproved.  \nA fact is proved when after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to \nexist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ou ght, in the circumstances \nof the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exist.  To this end, a \nperson, who desires a court to give judgment as to any legal rights or liability dependent in \nthe existence of facts, which he asserts, mu st prove that the facts exist (section 131 Evidence \nAct, 2011, Elemor v. Gorriolende  (1968) . Thus it lies not on the party who denies but on him \nwho asserts (affirmatively or negatively) to prove the facts alleged.  The law also provides \nexceptions to this  rule that he who asserts must prove and would require no evidence of \ncertain facts.  Rather, the law permits an inference or deduction, having regard to the rules \nof law and practice of courts.  Such inferences or deductions are presumption \u2013 a kind of \ninvocation of the rule of law, which compels a judge to reach a particular conclusion in the \nabsence of evidence to the contrary.  In essence, a presumption is a substitute for evidence, \nor one way of establishing a matter other than by evidence.

The Act merely states:  \nSection 145  \n(i)     Whenever it is provided by this Act that the Court may presume a fact, it may \neither regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved or may call for \nproof of it.  \n(ii)      Whenever it is direct ed by the Act that the Court shall presume a fact, it shall \nregard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved.  \n(iii) When one fact is declared by this Act to b e conclusive proof of another, the court \nshall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as  proved, and shall not allow \nevidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it.  \n \n3.1.1 Admission and Presumptions  \nPresumptions, like admissions, are inferences as to any facts in issue or relevant facts, and \nrequire no prove or evidence to the contrary .  But the court, in its discretion, may require \nfacts (though admitted) to be proved otherwise than by admission.  Once the requisites are \nfulfilled, the court must draw the necessary presumptions. See sections 20 -27, Evidence Act, \n2011.  \n3.1.2  `Judicial N otice and Presumptions  \nWhat is Judicially Noticed is presumed and like presumptions are exceptions to the rule that \nwho asserts must prove.

Let us look at some of them.  \n \n3.4.1  Irrebuttable Presumptions ( Presumptio Juris  et de jure ) \nThis type of presumption is conclusive and incontrovertible and does not admit of \nevidence in disproof.  \n Examples are: \n- That a child under the age of seven years is in doli incapax , cannot have a guilty mind and \ntherefore incapable of committing a criminal offence.  He lacks criminal responsibility \n(Criminal Code, section 30 and Penal Code, section 50).  \n- That a boy who is under the age of twelve years is incapable of committing rape or other \noffences involving carnal knowledge as a principal offender.

Whenever the requisites are \nestablished, the co urt must draw the inference. It is founded upon reasons of public policy, \nsocial convenience and safety, which are warranted by the legal experience of the court in \nits administration of justice.  There are two classes of presumption \u2013 conclusive and \nirreb uttable and rebuttable or prima facie .  Its effect is to establish a fact without any or \ncomplete proof, operating as substitute evidence and as a way of establishing a matter than \nby evidence.  See Section 145 -168, Evidence Act, 2011.  \n \n5.0 SUMMARY  \nIn the law of Evidence, he who asserts must prove. But the Evidence Act provides a number \nof exceptions to this principle; permitting inference or deductions and empowering the court \nto reach particular conclusions in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  \nAn examp le of such exceptions is a \u201cpresumption\u201d.

But it may refuse to take judicial notice of a solitary \ninstance of the application of a custom.  \n \nOther examples where the judge has re fused to take judicial notice are:  \n \n1) Internal arrangements of a government department or of government departments or of \ngovernment corporations (Mutete v NRC 1961)  \n \n2) The fact that the general Hospital is a public place (Cyril Arch V Cop (1959) . \n  \n3) W hen certain elements go to constitute an offence, they must be strictly proved and the \ncourt cannot take judicial notice of such facts or act on its own private knowledge.  \n \nAguda has pointed out that Sec. 73 (1) of the Evidence Act 2004(now section 122, Ev idence \nAct 2011) is not a full catalogue of what the judge can judicially notice. He has argued that \nsection 73(2) (now section 122) allows the judge to take judicial notice of other facts which \nare not expressly listed.  \n \n4.0 CONCLUSION  \nJudicial notice ref ers to facts which a judge can be called upon to receive and to act upon \neither from his general knowledge of them or from enquiries to be made by himself for his \nown information from sources to which it is proper for him to refer. It is obligatory that th e \ncourt takes judicial notice of the facts enumerated in section 122 (1) of  the  2011 Evidence \nAct,  while it exercises discretion in others.  \n \n5.0 SUMMARY  \nIn this unit, you learnt about judicial notice. It is the acceptance of the truth of a fact without \nproof because it is within the court\u2019s own knowledge.

It is for the court to decide the question having \nconsidered the circumstance, under which it was made and what due weight is fa irly to be \nattached to it.  \n \nYou ma y ask if an admission by Mrs. X can bind M. The answer may turn out to be whether \nor not there has been a relationship of the type enumerated in section 122 of the Evidence \nAct. Under English Law an admission by a drunken person may be admissible even though he \nwas given the alcohol in the hope that he would make the admission. It is most likely that a \nNigeria court will follow this and admit in evidence an admission made by a drunken man.  \n \nIt appears then that an admission  may be voluntary or involuntary.

In \ncollusion cases, admission of fault by one of the drivers is an admission only against its \nmake r, not the owner of the vehicle. You would observe from these cases that conduct (eg. \nSilence) has been held to be admissions in some cases and non -admission in others. \nAdmission by conduct does not appear to be expressly mentioned in section 122 of the \nEvidence Act, but courts lean in favour of active conduct.  \n \n4. 0. Conclusion  \nAn admission is a statement, oral or documentary or conduct which suggests any inference \nas to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons, and in the \ncircumstance, mentioned in the Evidence Act (Section 20) includes admission by privy \n(Section 21).  Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but operate as \nestoppel.  \n \n5. 0 Summary  \nAdmission may take the form of a statement, (oral or document ary), or conduct.

Gender equality implies that women\u2019s/girls\u2019 needs, \ninterests, concerns, experiences, and priorities as well as those of men/boys and the socially \nexcluded are an integral dimension of polic y/programme design, implementation, monitoring, \nand follow -up, and evaluation at all levels.  \n \nWhile recognising that Government has the primary responsibility to develop and implement \npolicies to promote gender equality, women empowerment, and social inclu sivity, partnerships \nbetween government and the different social players in the civil society are increasingly \nrecognised as an important mechanism to achieve gender equality/social inclusivity policy goal.  \n \nThe review of the National Gender Policy 2006 be comes necessary due to the following:  \ni. Despite women constituting about half of the population and accounting for 60% of the \nvoting population in Nigeria (UN Women, 2019) , glaring gender gaps continue to \nconfront them in terms of representation in decision making, accessing and controlling \nresources and socio -economic opportunities;  \nii. The declining economic performance, poverty, erosion of cultural values, and the fallouts  \nfrom the global financial crisis have resulted in increased vulnerab ilities for the poor, \nmarginalis ed, widows, persons living with disabilities, and orphans, especially women \nand girls;  \niii. The need to adhere to predetermined periodic review processes as an inbuilt mechanism \nin tracking policy and performance implementation plan, to measure  progress, learn \nlessons, and embrace emerging issues;  \niv. Baseline indicators and performance parameters that revealed widening gender gaps in \nNigeria as compared to other countries, thus providing a timely opportunity to call \nattention to salient issues; an d \nv.

In furtherance of this goal, the government of Nigeria continues to commit \nresources (human and material) to the promotion of the full participation of women, men, girls, \nand boys in public life, and as agents of developme nt.    \n \nThe Federal Ministry of Women Affairs (FMWA) by its mandates strives to bring about speedy \nand healthy development of Nigerian women and men by formulating frameworks for \nengendering national development processes, thereby ensuring the survival, pr otection, \ndevelopment, and participation of all and sundry, especially those traditionally at the edge of \nnational development agenda. The primary target group includes women, children, the elderly, \nthe physically challenged, and all others needing social protection from the vagaries of social \ninjustice and discrimination.  \n \nThe policy review corroborated the emphasis that strong national machinery for the advancement \nof women and the promotion of gender equality requires political commitment at the highest \nlevel, and availability of all necessary human and financial resources to initiate, recommend and \nfacilitate the development, adoption, and monitoring of policies, legislation, programmes and \ncapacity building for the empowerment of women and to act as a c atalyst for open public \ndialogue on gender equality as a societal goal. Succinctly, the new revised policy is apt to \naddress the systemic nature of gender mainstreaming and the need for both traditional and non -\ntraditional gender sectors to embrace gender transformation and the changes which accompany \nthis. \n \nThe revised National Gender Policy is aligned with relevant regional and international protocols \nand instruments such as the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), New Partnership for African \nDevelopment ( NEPAD), AU Solemn Declaration for Gender Equality, African Protocol on \nPeople\u2019s Rights, and the Rights of Women (APPRRW), the Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), International Conference on \nPopulation Development Plan of Action (ICPD PoA), the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  and importantly, the Nigerian \nEconomic Recovery and Growth Plan (2017 - 2020), which is to be replaced by a new 10 -year \nEconomic Plan. The Policy seeks to equip stakeholders with strategic skills for engineering the \nlevels of social change required for achievi ng the desired empowerment of women, girls, the \nelderly, persons living with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups in our society.  \n \nThe Federal Ministry of Women Affairs1, as a national vehicle with mandates to entrench gender \nequality principles and human -centred development, seeks the creation of Gender Cadre in the \nsystem to facilitate professionalization and institutionalisation of gender equality; women \nempowerment; and gender mainstreaming as an administrative/development tool.  \n \nNo doubt, the 200 6 National Gender Policy has helped in many ways.

This review should have been \ndone in 2011, but a number of exigencies did not allow this to happen until October 2020, when \nthe process for this review started. The production of the policy involved 3 Phases. Phase 1 \u2013 A \nSituation Analysis R eview and Report writing, Phase 2 \u2013 Development of the Revised National \nGender Policy using the key findings from the Situation Analysis Report to refocus policy \npriorities and action and Phase 3 \u2013 the Development of the National Strategic Implementation \nFramework for the policy.  Hence, apart from the main Policy Document, there are also two \ncomplementary reports; that is, the 2021 Situation Analysis Report; and the 2021 \nImplementation Framework for the National Gender Policy.  \n \nThe Situation Analysis, whic h was the first phase of the policy review process, involved the \nreview of national and international documents on women and gender issues; existing \nstate/ sectorial  gender policies; key indicators, and secondary data sources across the sectors and \nzonal wo rkshops across the six (6) geo -political zones.  Consultants and technical assistants held \ndiscussions with stakeholders at Federal, State, Local Government levels; and also with Nigerian \nscholars in the diaspora, and the private sector actors.  Focus Grou p Discussions (FGD) were \nheld with CSO representatives across the zones; in -depth interviews with development partners \nand with employers of labour in the private sector institutions.  Series of public dialogues were \nalso held with community members \u2013 men,  women, boys, and girls.  These were done to ensure \nthat emerging issues were well captured, and also to ensure comprehensive and widespread \nownership of the policy document.  Thus, all three phases of the process witnessed the conduct \nof Validation and Fi nalisation Workshops to ensure the adoption of the respective outcomes by \nstakeholders at the various levels \u2013 national, state, and community levels. Following the \nactivities enumerated herein, individuals, groups, institutions, and governments contributed  \nimmensely to the success of this policy review process.  \n \nFirst, we will like to put on record the overwhelming support of President Mohammadu Buhari\u2019s \nAdministration, for putting the women\u2019s issues at the centre of his government\u2019s economic \nrecovery and growth plan agenda, and hoping for more visibility for women in this government. \nNigerian women expect a greater commitment to the 50:50 parity for women to benefit more in \npublic life.  \n \nThe Honourable Minister for Women Affairs, HE: Dame Pauline  Tallen, OFR, KSG;  who is a \ngender advocate, and pride to womanhood, fitted perfectly to the gender transformative agenda, \nwhile her invaluable contributions to the success of this policy review remain notable. The \nsuccess of this review is largely due to the suppo rt received from the Minister, and the office of \nthe Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.  The revision of the National \nGender Policy started under the leadership of Mrs. Ifeoma Nkiru Anagbogu, Dr. Ifeoma \nAnyanwutaku , Ambassador Anthonia  Ekpa -PhD, and was completed under the able leadership \nof Engr. Adebiyi O. Olufunso , FNSE.  \n \nVarious key officers of government at the various levels (Federal/State/LGA) contributed \nimmensely to the outcome of this review. We also acknowledge the support given by the Senior \nSpecial Assistant to the President on Gender Matters to this process.

In tandem with emerging global trends, particularly  as the global development \nagenda translated from the Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals, a \nreview of the National Gender Policy became expedient to address current challenges.  \n \nSince its inception, the policy statement and its d irectives have been bolstered through various \nregional and international agreements, to which Nigeria is a party; aimed towards gender justice, \ngender equality, women\u2019s empowerment, and social inclusion. The ERGP - the Nigeria \nEconomic Recovery and Growth Plan and its recent review - the new Nigeria\u2019s National \nEconomic Plan makes a national commitment to re -dressing long -term systemic discrimination \nagainst women, identifying and overcoming the limitations to the empowerment of women and \nmen, and social inc lusion issues; and ultimately creating a society that values gender balance and \nequity for ALL.  \n \nBased on the most recent and available gender -disaggregated data, there are indications of \nsignificant inequalities experienced by women and men in Nigeria. However, there is also a \nsignificant deficiency in the availability of sex -disaggregated data acros s all sectors and at all \nlevels.  \n \nThe implementation of the National Gender Policy is therefore crucial to the attainment of \nNigeria\u2019s development goals, medium and long -term strategic targets, and maintenance of \nregional and international commitments tow ards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. \nThe policy rationale and purpose seek to propel the historical and political movement for gender \nequality by providing a policy framework with professional analysis, implementation, and \nmonitoring. The policy p resents a rights -based approach to achieving gender equality, women \nempowerment, and social inclusion; and promotes programmes that must be developed against \nan understanding of international commitments, and constitutional agreements. Gender equality \nrequires equal enjoyment by women and men of all the socially valued goods, opportunities, \nresources, and rewards afforded by one's citizenship. Gender equity strives for the equalization \nof the life chances of women and men, and those naturally excluded from the development \nmainstream.  \n \nThe National Gender Policy aims to institute a paradigm shift in national policy -making and \nimplementation from a gender -sensitive position that presumes gender equality and equity, to a \ngender -aware position which acknowledge s that barriers exist which prevent equal access and \nthus creates inequality.  \n \nThe National Gender Policy is informed by the guiding principles of social justice; human rights; \nequality and equity; good governance, accountability, transparency, and partic ipation. In order to \nachieve gender equality, the following strategies and tools must be deployed: gender \nmainstreaming; gender -responsive budgeting; gender -aware information; gender analysis; cross -", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3242, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "134daebc-2f42-4af5-aae0-adb4e5b299e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "134daebc-2f42-4af5-aae0-adb4e5b299e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e2e515d-51ab-45d7-a527-baf77d4f9c06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "058b20ef0f1adbd01f878becb61024f33d9078134f5611c7911ec91e064ed8ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n sectoral partnering/collaborations; gender training; gend er-aware monitoring and evaluation, and \nthe legislation of temporary special measures (gender -responsive affirmative actions).  \n \nAll public and private stakeholders are responsible for employing gender mainstreaming \nstrategies with the guidance and support  of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs .

The adoption and implementation of the 2006 \nNational Gender Policy across sectors and institutions was geared towa rds addressing gender \ninjustice and gender inequalities within the Nigerian institutions and systems. Notably, the 2021 \nSituation Analysis Report documented progress made in achieving the goals of the 2006 \nNational Gender Policy, and impediments confrontin g the full implementation of the policy \npriorities and actions. Important inhibiting factors confronting the goals of the 2006 NGP \ninclude: low technical capacity for coordination and gender mainstreaming; limited \naccountability for joint actions in policy  implementation and funding to domesticate the policy \nby state and non -state actors; the tendency to treat the policy solely as a \u2018woman\u2019s issue\u2019 and \npersisting socio -cultural barriers against discourse on gender equality issues.  \n \nRevising the 2006 Nationa l Gender Policy is an integral part of the evaluation and sustainability \nmechanism built into the policy\u2019s implementation plan.  The aim was to enable practitioners to \ntake stock and learn lessons from the past with a view to accommodate new sets of emergi ng \ngender issues, which demand urgent attention and ensure steady progress in the quest for gender \nand social justice. It also aids continuous engagement with the policy as a means of ensuring that \nNigeria has a living policy.  \n \nThe overall objective of the gender equality goal is a society in which women and men; girls and \nboys; and other vulnerable groups enjoy the same opportunities, rights, and obligations in all \nspheres of life. Thus, like the 2006 NGP, the goal of 2021 is -  \n \u201cto build a just society devoid of discrimination, where the needs and concerns of \nwomen, men, girls, boys, and other vulnerable groups are mainstreamed equitably into \nall sectors of national development\u201d  \n \nThus, the revised policy is premised on the fol lowing key principles:  \ni. That the promotion and protection of women\u2019s rights as  human rights, provision of \nsocial buffers and safety nets, social justice, and equity are critical to national \ncohesion, growth, and stability;  \nii. That the  peculiarity of the needs  of women and girls, as distinct from men and boys, \nare demonstrably  not homogeneous, originate from  varying circumstances and \ntherefore demand distinct policy responses at sector and sub -sector levels ;  \niii. That the gender policy  is central to the achievement of overall national development \ngoals, objectives, and targets on many fronts and from both the macro to the micro \neconomic levels as gender equality is a driver of growth and good governance ; \niv. That the cooperative interaction  of all stakeholders including government, private \nsector, civil society organisations, traditional and religious leaders, community -based \norganisations and development partners at all levels is required to drive effective \nimplementation of the policy;  \nv. That implementation shall build on existing structures and draw on international \npolicy frameworks, protocols,  experiences and practices including affirmative action", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3339, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6cfdc8b-b1ef-4d6a-929d-26ca2532b2dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6cfdc8b-b1ef-4d6a-929d-26ca2532b2dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6ae17d3-5987-4778-8cec-7a67ec3a273b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "ad19b33c765e1c2c2c3054a87ecc143debee4b31e99c96875e460fbfb3b873f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n interventions targeting women and girls, recognizing them as corrective measure to \nbridge ga ps in opportunities and access to resources; and  \nvi.

Introduction  \nThe National Gender Policy (NGP) represents a set of minimum standards expected of the \nNigerian Government to meet its mandate for gender equality, good governance, \naccountability, and being socially responsive to the needs of its vulnerable groups.  Equity \nremains the founda tion of the core principle of Agenda 2030 - \u2018leave no one behind\u2019.   By \nimplication, achieving this core principle demands that \u2018gendered power relations\u2019 which \nserve as triggers of social, political, cultural, and economic exclusion are dealt with, while the \nbenefits of sustainable development are extended to groups that are routinely and structurally \nexcluded, that is, women, girls, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and the poor among \nothers.  The policy (NGP) is also in consonant with the Constitut ion of the Federal Republic \nof Nigeria, the supreme law of the land, which includes specific provisions protecting human \nrights and fundamental freedoms.  \n \nNotably, progress and development in human societies require the participation of both men \nand women.  However, it is a truism that women h ave been historically marginalis ed in all \nspheres of life including social, economic, and political spheres. This anomaly has been \nrecognised globally and it has become accepted that issues of women\u2019s human rights are \nimportant for any meaningful development to take place.  Apart from social justice, which \ndemands equal opportunity for all citizens, it is smart economics to plan with both halves of \none\u2019s population because it benefits society as a whole. Investing in wom en and girls does \nnot only create a positive development cycle, the opposite is also adjudged to be true, that is, \na country that fails to empower half of its population will suffer from lower productivity, \nslower economic growth, and weaker development ou tcomes.  \n \nWomen make up about 50% of Nigeria\u2019s population  (UN Women, 2019) . Considering both \nthe intrinsic and extrinsic values of gender equality, women and girls are now seen as very \ncentral to Nigeria\u2019s transformative agenda, without which it will be dif ficult to achieve any \nsustainable development and growth. Families are healthier, safer, and better nourished when \nthe women raising them are more knowledgeable and capable of meeting their needs.  \nDevelopment standpoints on women\u2019s need and welfare are al so helping to refocus attention \non the situation of girls across nations. If resources reach women and girls early, \ntransformative change can happen quickly, while poverty can be stopped before it starts. The \ninvincibility of this standpoint was aptly note d in the UNDP perspective on the gender \ndebate, that \u2018 a development that is not engendered is endangered\u2019  (Human Development \nReport, 1995) . Simply, to achieve sustainable development, countries must plan with their \nmen and women, and focus on their unique needs and preferences.   \n \nThe recent experience with the COVID -19 outbreak in Nigeria exposed the structural \ninequalities that systematica lly disadvantage women and girls. COVID -19 causes an increase \nin women\u2019s workloads, caring for children as schools closed, and taking care of family \nhealth. Additionally, there is a risk of increased family violence in a region where pre -\nexisting rates of violence against women are already very high. While all vulnerable \npopulations experience COVID -19 outbreaks and impacts differently, issues such as access to \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), disrupted livelihoods and caused an increase in \nfamily vio lence, while its health impact affects women disproportionately.

Strict \nadherence to traditional masculine roles is also identified as impacting negatively on men and \nboys and may also heighten their vulnerabilities as they (men/boys) struggle to meet \nsometimes unattainable standards created for them in their traditional masculine roles.  \n \n1.2. Legal and Policy Environment  \n \n1.2.1. Key Learning Points from the International  and Regional Legal & Policy \nEnvironment  \n \nAwareness of the need to promote gender equality and social inclusion as a human rights \nissue has grown tremendously worldwide, especially since the International Conference on \nWomen in Beijing in 1995. Most countr ies have since then put in place structures that \npromote the rights of women, gender equality, and inclusivity in policy and planning for \ndevelopment.  The impetus for the development of National Gender Policies has been \nprovided by international, regional , and national legal and policy environments.  \n \nThe vision for a new global order that guarantees all individuals basic human rights and \nprotection from all forms of discrimination is at the heart of various international instruments \n(treaties, declaration s, and conventions) signed by the UN member -states, including Nigeria. \nSuch legal instruments include:  \n\u25cf The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948 \nentrenched the guiding principles of the secular state and human rights culture \nglobally, whereby almost all the countries of the world affirmed their commitment to \na basic common standard of human rights;  \n\u25cf The 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cult ural Rights (ICESCR), both of \nwhich included a clause that guarantees the rights to non -discrimination between men \nand women. Others are the Convention on the Political Rights of Women (1952); the \nConvention on the Nationality of Married Women (1957); and the Convention on the \nConsent to Marriage (1962).  \n\u25cf The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women \n(CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, which is often \ndescribed as the \u2018international bill of rights of women \u2019. It codified women\u2019s rights to \nequality in all spheres of life as a global norm.  \n\u25cf The Beijing Conference of 1995 provided a unique opportunity for women to become \na critical part of the decision -making process in matters relating to economic, \npolitical, and social advancement the world over. The Beijing Platform for Action \n(BPfA) touched on 12 critical areas of women\u2019s concerns across wellbeing, decision \nmaking, advancement, and safe spaces.     \n\u25cf The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (2000) as a  global strategy for \npoverty reduction further heightened the need to focus on the improvement of the \nstatus of women, while at its expiration in 2015, a new set of Sustainable", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3562, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4b6ff60-929d-4d19-b315-7b2ff659741c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4b6ff60-929d-4d19-b315-7b2ff659741c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9480741f-92d0-4cbe-a5e4-fb0e9be04fb2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "d3f3152f948be2e9bfe8aac4a7cd1e61e9f3dcca099673c75dcde036adf2e3ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n Development Goals (SDGs) was adopted by the United Nations further propelled a \nglobal vision for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of girls as a \ncentral point to all the 17 SDGs, and to be inculcated into various fields of human \nendeavour.  \n \nAt the regional level, Africa has responded to the global waves of rights and  development. In \n1981, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights was adopted as a major continental \ninstrument in the field of human rights protection in Africa. In addition, Nigeria ratified the \nProtocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples'  Rights on the Rights of Women in \nAfrica (Maputo Protocol) on 16 December 2004. As expressed in the African Charter on \nHuman and People\u2019s Rights (ACHPR), which was adopted in 1981 and became operational \non October 21, 1986, member states established bodies  to protect and promote human and \npeople\u2019s rights. The most important obligation for each country is to adopt legislative or other \nmeasures to protect the dignity of Africa and its people.  \n \nThe New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) adopted in Ju ly 2001 was equally \ndesigned to address the current challenges facing the African continent. It addresses issues \nsuch as escalating poverty levels, underdevelopment, and the continued marginalisation of \nAfrica in the globalisation processes, which were of serious concern to Africa leaders. \nImportantly, NEPAD has the acceleration of women empowerment as one of its strategic \nobjectives, as it anchors the development of Africa on its resources and the resourcefulness of \nits people, and ensuring that all partne rships with NEPAD are linked to all internationally \nagreed development targets and the gender equality and social inclusion agenda  \n \nThe adoption of the AU Gender Policy in 2009 and its implementation plan has been inspired \nby the overwhelming political wi ll and commitment demonstrated by the African Union\u2019s \nHeads of States and Government who in the last few years have adopted important decisions.  \n \nAt the sub -regional level, the ECOWAS Gender Policy  development process was initiated in \n2000 and the gender policy document was finalised in 2003 with the establishment of a \nGender Technical Commission, a Gender Division within the Executive Secretariat, and the \ntransformation of ECOWAS Gender Development Centre, which provides the necessary \nstructures and frame works for gender mainstreaming and a Strategic Plan framework and \nguidelines on the structures and mechanisms of the Gender Management Systems (GMS) for \nECOWAS.

Nigeria has ratified the International Convention on \nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;  International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights (29 -10-93); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \n(29-10-93); Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women \n(13-7-85); Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment \nor Punishment (28 -7-01) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (19 -4-9). \n \nHowever, Nigeria continues to perform very poorly gauging by the synthesis of performances \nacross the four dimensions of the Gender Gap Index adopted globally. In the Economic \nParticipation and Opportunity sub -index, Nigeria ranked 38 position (among 153 countries \nbenchmarked) and with a score of 0.738 Gender Gap Index  (World Economic Forum, 2021) .  \nFor Health and Survival sub -index, Nigeria ranked 135 position with a GGI of 0.964  (World \nEconomic Forum, 2021) . For the Education Attainment sub -index, Nigeria ranked 1 45 \nposition with a GGI of 0.806  (World Economic Forum, 2021) . Notably, Nigeria ranked 146 \nposition in the Political Participation sub -index, with a GGI score of 0.032  (World Economic \nForum, 2021) .  Overall, Nigeria ranked 145 in 2013, moving to 128 positio n in 2020, in the \nGlobal Gender Gap Index (World Data Atlas, 2021) , thereby falling much behind such \nAfrican countries like Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, \nMozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe among others.  Nigeria needs to learn from oth er \ncountries, in particular, African countries that have engaged in gender transformative changes \nwithin the context of their respective local cultures.  \n \nThe combination of federation and a tripartite system of civil, customary, and religious law \nmakes it difficult to harmonise legislation and remove discriminatory measures. However, \nany law, which is contradictory to Federal Law , or the Constitution can be challenged in a \nFederal Court. With a legal system with varying legal standards,  the Nigeria Constitu tion \nprovides the ultimate principles, rules, and doctrines from which the legitimacy and hierarchy \nof all other legal norms in the country are validated.  \n \n1.2.3.

In view of current ev ents and emerging issues across sectors, it is important to \nup-date and review the existing NGP so as to respond to emerging issues across sectors, and \ncurrent gender gaps to be filled for Nigeria to meet its commitment to such global agenda as \nthe Sustain able Development Goals (SDGs).

Against \nthis background, three key elements, referred to here as the GEESI Framework ( Gender \nEquality, Empowerment of Women, and Social Inclusion ) drives this pol icy (see Figure 1). \nThe overall objective of gender equality is a society in which women and men; girls and boys \nenjoy the same opportunities, rights, and obligations in all spheres of life.

The ERGP  was envisioned to \npromote  sustained inclusive growth. With th e post -ERGP appraisals, it is becoming more \nobvious that Nigeria will need to adopt gender equality as a core development objective in its \nown right, and as a smart business practice for equitable distribution of opportunities and \nresources for enhanced pr oductivity and sustainable human development, so that \u2018 no one is \nleft behind\u2019 . To ensure that gender issues and women\u2019s concerns are appropriately integrated \ninto the macro -economic framework (the engine of national development), it is important to \naddress  the structures that continue to perpetuate gender inequality and women's dis -\nempowerment. This will necessitate a holistic review of all existing legislations and policies \nusing a gender lens, whereby gender concerns are treated as one of the primary pill ars of the \nnational development plan with the intention of making opportunities for advancement \navailable to women, men, girls, boys and all the vulnerable groups (the aged, the persons with \ndisabilities among others).  \n \nIn aligning with Nigeria\u2019s economic outlook, the  gender policy framework adopts the basic \nneeds approach which defines the absolute minimum resources necessary for long -term \nphysical well -being usually in terms of consumption patterns and the quality -of-life model.  \nGenerally, the poverty li ne is defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those basic \nneeds, including requirements for food, housing, security, shelter, good health, and education. \nThe basic needs approach helps to measure development in terms of a country's ability to \nmeet the basic requirements for life.

LEGISLATION AND POLICY REFORMS  \n \nSituation Analysis and Policy Concern  \nThe normative framework for the promotion and protection of gender equality, women \nempowerment, and social inclusion in Nigeria, is anchored on legislative, judicial, policy, and \nInternational Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Treaties to which Nigeria is a signatory. \nNigeria continues to perform very poorly gauging by the synthesis of performances across the \nfour dimensions of the Gender Gap Index adopted globally, mainly because of  non -\nadherence to its own human rights principles as stated in the 1999 Co nstitution (as amended), \nand a mirage of global and regional Treaties and Conventions on human and women\u2019s rights.  \nNigeria is replete with patriarchal values that undervalue women\u2019s contributions to national \ndevelopment, and their roles in the development  process.  Human rights abuses, including \ngender -based violence among others, are the order of the day.  \n \nPolicy Statement  \n \nAchieve a national re -orientation in the commitment to gender equality, women \nempowerment, and social inclusion principles and concer ns \n \nObjectives  \ni. Eliminate gender discriminatory policies and laws both at the federal and state \nlevels; and in the private sector institutions.  \nii. Mainstream gender and social inclusion concerns in all existing policies and laws  \niii. Implement Gender Equality polic ies and laws  \niv.

The proportion of youths (aged 15 -24) not in school, employment, \nand training stood at 38% in 2018 (Innocent, 2014) . In some workplaces, women earn less \nthan men for equal work, and they miss out on promotions when they have  to go for \nmaternity leave. They work shorter hours with the attendant appraisal that their contribution \nis less than optimal. The numbers are also troubling in the public service, where it is \napproximately a 30:70 women to men ratio, as the employee profi le data shows (NBS, 2016) . \nLabour laws are archaic and do not consider the shifting nature of the workplace and the \nemergence of platform economics, making it more difficult for workers to organise and \nengage employers (World Bank, 2018) .  \n \n \nPolicy Statement :  \n \nInclusive labour practices that can enhance the growth of economies and the development of \nall citizens  \n \nObjectives:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 2841, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5766eb2b-de1a-44f7-afa7-46f69d7484fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "5766eb2b-de1a-44f7-afa7-46f69d7484fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55e9fdc0-232e-4048-b08e-1c57d959a07c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "e4c93cd8bbafb1e93850eed484b292fac1c327251b84361da44318ba60333806", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n i.

Neither  of \nthese enterprises operate with a form of legal nor financial protection. Similarly, over 75.6% \nand 65% of Microenterprises and SMEs, respectively, have no business plans. Worse still is \nthat 97.8% of the Micro enterpri ses are not registered, while 96.6% of them are uninsured \n(Salihu et al., 2015) .

Consequently, the mortality rate of these enterprises is 20%. \nAlthough in 2017, 59. 6 million jobs were created by MSMEs in terms of the number of \nemployees per enterprise compared to only five percent (5%) or 2.8 million of the jobs \ncreated by other stakeholders in the economy.

Sports & Entertainment Industry  \n \nSituation and Policy Concern  \n \nNigeria is yet to harness the passion of its citizenry for sports and to develop sports as an \nindustry that can align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for \npropelling economic, social, and community development. The fact that the  National Bureau \nof Statistics (NBS) does not classify sports as an economic sector activity but rather as \nrecreation speaks to the position sports occupy in national planning. Sports were not captured \nas a contributor in rebasing the economy in 2014 (Dand aura, 2014)  .  The social factors \nhampering the industry include the fact that there is no coherent initiative or regulation that \nwill encourage mass participation in sports through fitness and recreation to develop a \nhealthy lifestyle among the citizenry.  In addition, gender participation is not fully leveraged \nbecause of inadequate policies to accommodate women's special needs in sports at both \nparticipatory and management levels and the disparity of remuneration between female and \nmale athletes. Lastly, the absence of sufficient infrastructure for the development and \nmanagement of sports at the grassroots level is a deterrent for the use of sports for social \ninclusivity and community development (Dandaura, 2014) . \n \nThe Nigeria home movie industry, Nollywoo d, is Africa's largest producing movie industry \nand is only next to India's Bollywood in the global ranking, producing about 200 videos per \nmonth and grossing USD 250 million annually  (Osinubi, 2021) ).

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT  \n \nContext  \n \nBy 2030, more than one -third of the Nigerian populace will be between the ages of 16 and 30 \nyears (Price, 2019) . The estimation is that young people within this age group will be around \n68 million, and by 2050 it would have increased to 131 million. This demographic boom has \nsome inherent dividends that must be harnessed to ensure optimal realisation of the potenti als \nof this youthful boom to outweigh the burden of dependence from children and older persons.  \nThe prospects for the demographic boom are currently being threatened except conscious \nefforts are invested into more inclusive education, employment, and soci al security \nprogrammes for young people. Otherwise, by the year 2050, Nigeria will have a youthful \npopulation that is poorly educated, lack sufficient soft and survival skills, poor in ideas, and \neasy tools for violence. They are also likely to be less con fident in competing with their peers \nin other environments and are more likely to be vulnerable to early marriage and high \nfertility. The National Population Commission (NPC) has estimated that no fewer than 19 \nmillion Nigerians are persons with disabiliti es (PWDs) in Nigeria (Birchall, 2019) Less than \n1% of PWDs are employed in the formal sector (Thompson, 2020)  \n \nWomen in Nigeria remain significantly disadvantaged across a broad sphere of life. Starting \nwith health, risks are embedded in bearing, and reari ng children, infant mortality and \nmalnutrition, sexually transmitted diseases, and costs of treating such conditions. More \nexamples of risks are found in life cycle hazards such as divorce and widowhood, food \ninsecurity, social obligations in marriage, and  domestic violence. There is also literacy risk \nimposed on women through cultural expectations and limitations which deny girls \nempowerment opportunities attainable through quality education.  To elevate women and \npoor households, the National Cash Transfe r Office was created and commenced programme \nimplementation in September 2016, focusing on three thematic issues: uplifting household \nprogram, livelihood support, and building capacity. Some of the Ministries are beginning to \nappreciate the gender issues i n their sectors and also allocate resources to finance them. For \ninstance, the Ministry of Education now has a Girl's education budget line following its \ngender analysis of the gaps in the education sector, and the Ministry of agriculture has a \nGender Poli cy (2019).  \n \nThe crucial issue under human development is how Nigeria impacts the bottom of the \npyramid through economic and social empowerment programmes for women, young people, \nhouseholds and small businesses, the elderly, and persons with disabilities . If resources reach \nwomen and girls early, transformative change can happen quickly, while poverty can be \nstopped before it starts (Aina, Atela, Ojebode, Dayil, & Aremu, 2019) .

The Federal Government of Nigeria launched the National Policy for the In tegrated \nEarly Childhood Development (IECD) in Abuja on the 8th October, 2007. The policy aims to \nensure a good start in life for all young Nigerian children under five years of age through the \nprovision of adequate health care, nutrition, access to safe w ater and sanitation, early \nlearning, psycho -social stimulation and protection. This will create the conditions for every \nNigerian child to thrive and develop to their fullest potential and will ensure smooth \ntransition for the child from home to primary sc hool.  \n \nThe policy was to achieve within five years, full immunisation for all children 0 -5 years; \nreduction in infant and maternal mortality rates; adequate ante -natal care for all pregnant \nwomen; the smooth transition of the child from home to school; and increa sed enrolment in \nprimary school, retention and completion of full primary education cycle. The government's \nresponse to the COVID -19 pandemic, for example, did not take a gender equity and social \ninclusion lens. At the height of COVID -19, Northern Governor s deported Almajiri (itinerant \nQuranic school) children, majorly boys and some girls, back to their States of origin. So also, \nthe response system to gender -based violence issues, including those emerging from the \npandemic, is still relatively slow; there are insufficient safe spaces for survivors of gender -\nbased violence and insufficient Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) in the country.

Reproductive Health/HIV&AIDS/COVID -19 \n \nSituation Analysis and Policy Concern :  \nIn Nigeria, groups, particularly at risk of stigma, discrimination and exclusion, include \nwomen and girls; people with disabilities; ethnic and religious minorities; migrants and \ninternally displaced people; children and younger people; older people; sexua l minorities; \npeople without official identification; and people living with HIV (PLWHA).  In general, \nwomen and girls are more vulnerable to HIV and AIDs infection.  Trafficked persons may be \nforced to perform those sexual practices most associated with A IDS transmission. The \nconsequences of trafficking in girls and women from Nigeria include loss of lives, increasing \nprevalence of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, increased violence and \ncrime rate, increased school drop -out rates, and impa ired child development. Nigeria's HIV \nseroprevalence rate projection for 2012 is 3.3 (Auld et al., 2017) .  \n \nThe socio -economic environment is generally linked to hike in mental illness and suicide \nrates among the youthful age and those in high socio -econom ic status. Mental illness and \nother associated incidences of depression and suicide among women are generally associated \nwith relatively higher socio -economic status, older ages, and being unmarried. According to a \nstudy conducted by the Lagos State Mental  Health Survey (LSMHS) (2018), the point \nprevalence for symptoms of depression in females is 6.3% as against 4.9% for \nmales (Adewuya et al., 2018) . \n \nThe existing health service delivery system lacks the strategy and resources to address \nexisting gender disp arities in access to care and the quality of available services. Nigeria is \n2.64% of the world population but accounts for 20% of its maternal mortality (Rabiu et al., \n2018) .

Maternal & Child Health/Child Development  \n \nSituation Analysis and Policy Concerns  \nWomen in Nigeria remain significantly disadvantaged across a broad sphere of life. Starting \nwith health risks embedded in motherhood, rearing of children, infant mortality, malnutrition, \nsexually transmitted diseases , and costs of treating such conditions. The Nigeria maternal \nmortality ratio (MMR) was 512 deaths per 100.000 live births in 2018 (95% CI: 447 -578) \n(Akaba et al., 2021) . The MMR declined from 1400 deaths per 100.000 live births in 1990 to \nthe current valu e in 2018 (Akaba et al., 2021) . However, there are concerns about the rate of \ndecline despite many interventions. The Nigeria MMR is still high and very far from the \nSDG 3 of less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Women from rural areas and/o r \nfrom Northern Nigeria are at a higher risk of maternal deaths compared to their urban and/or \nSouthern counterpart due to higher fertility and some cultural issues. Low contraceptive \nprevalence rate (CPR) and demand were partly responsible for the high fe rtility rates. The \nCPR among married women aged 15 -49 years was 17% in 2018; while the unmet need in this \nsame group was 19%  (Akinbode, Sam -wobo, & Gloria, ND) . Nigeria has a male -dominant \nculture of patriarchy. Married women may have to get permission fro m their husbands before \nseeking health care. This culture has been reported to cause a delay in seeking care for \nwomen and children with regards to reproductive, maternal, new -born, and child health \nservices. Nigeria is also a highly religious country with  Christian, Islam, and Traditional \nreligions as the dominant religious groups.

For example, the percentage of primary school completion rate for both sexes was \n77.06% in 2017, while quality assurance mechanisms are weak despite a plethor a of \ninspection services at all levels of the system (UNICEF, 2021b) . Inequities in terms of \ngender, geographical zones, states, local governments, and schools are debilitating factors. \nCurricula are generally outdated and failed to focus on the developmen t of cognitive skills \nsuch as problem -solving, critical thinking and therefore inappropriate for the 21st, Century \ncritical thinking workplace. Large numbers of teachers are unqualified. Teachers are not well \ntrained and lack motivation; teaching methods a re out of date; there is insufficient teaching of \nlife skills, teaching/learning materials and access to technology are inadequate; teacher \ndeployment is inefficient. Very little learning leading to low achievement: 70% failure rate in \nWAEC (Asikhia, 2010) . There is limited GEESI content in teaching and learning culture.  \n \nGirls bear a disproportionate share of domestic work. For households leverage on the use of \ntechnology and gadgets, male children are usually prioritised in the use of these gadgets. The \ngirls are not given the same time to do school homework because they have more domestic \nchores. The girls take a back seat in terms of priority to children in accessing digitalised \nclassrooms. Girls might have little access to a digitised classroom in the future with its \nattendant consequence for quality and relevant learni ng.  \n \nPolicy Statement  \nFacilitating the delivery of an inclusive educational sector plan aligned with industry, market \nand life learning and the elimination of gender and disability disparities at all levels of \neducation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3543, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96daf280-0593-49e6-b4a5-15192e86111d": {"__data__": {"id_": "96daf280-0593-49e6-b4a5-15192e86111d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "153dcf17-3aa4-4293-b00e-357073b003ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "bba2082c7754665e2903ee430cbb21278b59d56458a37d15bbe65ee17882c80b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n Objectives  \ni.

Gender and Disability  \n \nSituation Analysis and Policy Concern  \nAbout 15 percent of Nigeria's population, or  at least 25 million people , have a disability  \n(Ewang, 2019) . Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) experience several  human rights abuses , \nincluding stigma, discrimination, violence, and lack of access to healthcare, housing, and \neducation. Women and girls with disabilities face tr iple barriers to full equality and \nadvancement because they are female, poor, and have a disability  (Olatunbosun, 2020) . They \nalso suffer disadvantages in essential aspects of daily living, such as education, employment, \nhealth, and housing. There are six clusters of disabilities recognised worldwide - blindness, \ndeafness, physical disability, disability from leprosy, spinal cord injury, and intellectual \ndisability. Disability affects women, men and children (Haruna, 2017)  .  Less than 5% of \nchildren and yo ung persons with disabilities have access to education and training. The \nincidence of maltreatment and abuse of women with disabilities far exceeds that of women \nwithout disabilities (Iglesias, Gil, Joneken, B, & Knudsen, 1998) . This is generally due to \nstigmas associated with both disability and gender. In many societies, women are generally \nseen as caregivers. When a disability prevents a woman from functioning fully in that \ncapacity, she is often viewed as a failure. Though the Nigeria Discrimination Aga inst Persons \nwith Disabi lities (Prohibition) Act of 2018 made special provisions for the protection of \npersons with disabilities, the Act failed to touch on the peculiar needs of women and girls \nwho face multiple oppressions based on their gender and disab ility status.  \n \nPolicy Statement  \nAn inclusive/gender responsive approach to understanding disability and meeting the needs \nof all persons with disabilities, with dignity .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3497, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f76f0ef1-06f9-4be3-a8b6-ca979812fc26": {"__data__": {"id_": "f76f0ef1-06f9-4be3-a8b6-ca979812fc26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4652c44b-a776-4835-9c9a-45751c6d4c22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "0a2c8efeec9b3280f81b187a12999e7b38251533d5e9ffe788609b0aec477b2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n Objectives:   \ni.

The provision of water services has impact on the improvement on \naccess to sanitation and hygiene. Without water, adequate sanitation and good hygi ene \npractices will be difficult to achieve. Women need water for domestic activities; cleaning, \nwashing and cooking; lack of water infrastructure puts more burden on women and children. \nBut pipe -borne water is found only in some urban and peri -urban areas.  Rural areas have few \nboreholes , and, in some places, they are broken down. Water is important for agriculture, \ndomestic and industrial use and for environmental harmony.  \n \nCOVID -19 has exposed the lack of good hygiene practices and the need for water servi ces to \nbe made available, as close as possible to the citizens (Rafaeli & Hutchinson, 2020) .  \nSanitation has been very challenging to manage, with Nigeria still on the list of countries \npracticing open defecation.

A wider analysis of the existing lack of proper housing \nhas compounded the needed access to clean and well -planned toilet facilities. Unfortunately, \nabout 7 in 10 women in Nigeria have no access to safe toilets,  which poses high health and \nabuse vulnerabilities and risks for women and girls (Wada, Olawade, Asogbon, Makinde, & \nAdebayo, 2021) .

Patriarchy is a major feature of traditional Nigerian society (Aina, 1998).   \n \nA major challenge in engaging with communities is that the traditional leaderships at the \ncommunity level, are basically patriarchal and therefo re characteristically operate as high-\npower  distance relationships whereby women, are considered less powerful members within \nthe community, firstly because of their gender, and secondly because the cultural norms \ndisempower them politically and economical ly. Women in communities, therefore, become \nsocialised from an early age to expect and accept as natural, that power is distributed \nunequally, with the men wielding most if not all of it.

Men in the GEESI Agenda  \n \nSituation Analysis and Policy Concerns  \nGender equality cannot be achieved by women alone or by focusing exclusively on women. \nGender equality concerns both women and men and requires the involvement of men as well \nas women. One of the reasons for the slow progress in achieving equality between women \nand men has been the lack of male involvement at all levels and lack of awareness among the \nmen on these issues. Situation analysis shows that men predominantly occupy positions of \nauthority and leadership of traditional and religious institutions in  communities across \nNigeria. They form the hierarchy as decision -makers, opinion leaders, and \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of \ntheir various communities. Any mechanism for effective engagement with the community \nmust engage these categories of stakeholders and re -educate them to appreciate that gender is \nabout justice.  \n \nMen\u2019s active support for gender equality has taken a variety of forms, including advocacy, \nalliances, campaigns, and educational programs for young men. Men\u2019s advocacy and action \non male violence against women have included networks of men who challenge existing \nstereotypes and men\u2019s roles in relationships.

Rwanda, Liberia, South Africa, Uganda, \nTanzania, Kenya, and Malawi are examples of such p olitical will on the African continent. \nSuch will is demonstrated in the provision of a fit -for-purpose gender architecture/machinery \nwith the necessary coordinating mandate. Adequate resourcing to finance the delivery and \nactualization of the policy objec tives and targets also rests squarely on leadership.

This policy will promote gender -\nresponsive budgeting as a viable strategy for effective  planning, as current data continue to \nshow low technical capacity for gender mainstreaming; poor funding of gender units and \nprogrammes; along with low capacity for gender budgeting across public and private \ninstitutions.  \n \nb.

For the most part, such laws offer no protec tion and opportunities for self -\nactualization to vulnerable groups, including women and girls, those with disabilities or \nminority groupings. Socia l legislation is required to drive provision of gender focused social \nprotection services including buffers, safety nets and other pro -poor initiatives targeting \nwomen, girls, and the socially excluded.  \n \nMost International treaties, particularly those that  relate to gender issues are yet to be  \ndomesticated and incorporated into the laws of the Federation. Violations of women\u2019s rights \nare further complicated by the existence of three legal systems \u2014English Law, Customary \nLaw and Sharia Law. One outcome of the  tripartite legal system is the presence of numerous \ngender insensitive local laws that are not easily documented and consequently difficult to \nmonitor. Furthermore, there are emerging trends and new dimensions of crimes or offences \nthat are not adequately  covered under existing laws.

This means that while we need \nlaws to give the basis for demand of certain rights there will always be  the need to work to \nenlighten different interest groups to change their per ceptions and attitudes toward specific \nissues.

Community participation in particular, is very critical in monitoring and \nevaluating progress on gender inequality moreover as many of th e obnoxious gender \npractices are predominately located in the community.  \n \nThe goal of tracking, monitoring and evaluation will in addition be to ensure compliance with \npolicy performance standards and enable continuous assessment and iterative learning \nprocesses . \n \nMonitoring and Evaluation is key to ensuring that gender is mainstreamed across board \nwithin the country.

Private Sector  \nNeo-liberal reform policies have been accompanied by privatization of government \nowned firms and the expansion of the private sectors with different opportunities for \nwomen and men in the productive sectors. The private sector has hitherto been ignored \nin terms of its ability to contribute to women\u2019s empowerment. However, it has the \npotential to create a conducive environment for women and contribute to their growth \nas employers of labour and partners with civil society. The private sector, being profit \noriented and capital intensive is currently dominated by men. Generally, women, \ncompared to men, lack ac cess to employment opportunities because of low investment \nin their human capital, especially their low level of education, and lack of skills \nappropriate for employment. The few women employed in the private sector work \nunder gruesome conditions. The Nige rian private sector is thus characterized by \noccupational sex segregation, gender -based discriminatory policies, gender unfriendly \nwork environment, gender -based labour abuse; and insensitivity to gender -based \nabuses among others. It is important for the F MWA and its allies to work closely with \nthe Private Sector to bring about the required change in the sector.  \n \ni. Communities  \nThe community plays a very significant role in the socialisation process of girls and \nboys which results in gender inequalities and st ereotypes. Although culture is not \nhomogeneous in Nigeria, there is nonetheless, a constant manifestation of patriarchal \nbias in the power structures, allocation of resources, and decision making. One \nconsequence of this is unequal opportunity and access t o economic goods and \nresources, lack of voice, and influence in policy and decision.  The new policy \nrecognises the changing roles of women and men, boys and girls in the economic, \nsocial, and political spheres of the community; thereby making gender equal ity a \ncross -cutting issue of concern. It is important to address the structures which continue \nto perpetuate gender inequities and social exclusions at the grassroots level under the \nmandates of this policy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3356, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d995772e-52fb-4b69-9d68-9cdc6fc41a29": {"__data__": {"id_": "d995772e-52fb-4b69-9d68-9cdc6fc41a29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09abecaf-d278-413f-9cb0-f7d1a31e66bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "9094647635e6f8defca043cdcd10691948205ddb3c849225f0092e3271e2b416", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n ii.

A \nmajor tool for the required social transformation remains the system -wide approac h of \npromoting gender and social inclusion mainstreaming and women\u2019s empowerment in all \npublic, private and community policies and programming priorities in Nigeria. The NGP is \npushing vigorously for a level playing field in terms of gender equity and soci al inclusion in \nall spheres of life thereby promoting the Gender Equality, Empowerment of Women, and \nSocial Inclusion Agenda (GEESI).  \n \nOver the years, the domestication of the National Gender Policy at both the State and the \nLocal Government levels, and b y the private sector institutions have been particularly slow \nand awareness of the existence of the NGP has remained low.  Although portions of the \npolicy have been used by different state and non -state actors in specific target areas , amongst \nthe 36 state s, not more than 17% (6 states) have developed  and approved a State level \nGender Policy. The States include Ekiti, Kaduna, Jigawa, Bauchi, Osun, and Delta States . \nAlso, a few federal level ministries, departments, and agencies (including the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Nigeria Police Force, INEC, EFCC, Nigeria Labour Congress, and some Federal \nUniversities) now have institutional -level Gender Policies. Despite this level of progress, the \nimplementation of these policies has been particularly slow and inadequ ate in depth. There \nalso remains a wide gap in the area of social inclusion, hence, this revised NGP has taken the \nGender Equality, Empowerment of women, and Social Inclusion (GEESI) approach.  \n \nA major challenge has been how to coordinate the gender and so cial inclusion mainstreaming \nefforts across sectors (public and private) without over -tasking the present structure.  The \nmandates for \u2018women empowerment\u2019, \u2018gender equality\u2019 and \u2018social inclusion\u2019 are the three \npillars of the National Gender Policy.  To en hance the achievement of these mandates, \nsupportive institutions and/or institutional reforms are needed.  Otherwise, the pursuit of one \nmay over -shadow the other if this process of change is not well articulated. Although most of \nthe Line Ministries (espe cially at the Federal level) have Gender Desk Officers, such officers \ndo not have the influence and authority to bring about required structural changes that could \nensure sustainable interest in gender mainstreaming across sectors. The NGP proposes a \nGende r Unit and/or a Gender Mainstreaming Office located in the office of the Permanent \nSecretary or equivalent in the respective MDAs; and including expanding the mandate of the \nFederal Character Commission to include Equal Opportunity for all.   \n \nTo further s trengthen the mandates of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, efforts need to \nbe taken for its restructuring and renaming. It is therefore recommended to  the government \nconsider changing the name of the Ministry of Women Affairs to the Ministry of Women  and \nGender Affairs. Its restructuring will include the creation of a Department  of \u2018Gender and \nSocial Inclusion\u2019 in addition to the existing Department of Women Affairs - with distinct \nroles and responsibilities.

It entails quantitative change s in \naggregates such as Gross National Product, as well as changes in institutional, social \nand administrative structures (Todaro,1989), with the objective of effecting the \nmaterial and social advancement of the population.  \nEngendering  As a gender concept , engendering refers to the process of integrating gender \nconsiderations and concerns into words, actions and assessment policies, programmes, \nprojects and other institutional functioning.  \nEmpowerment  Refers to the process of \u201cconscientisation\u201d which buil ds critical analytical skills for \nindividual to gain self -confidence in order to take control of her or his life. \nEmpowerment of women is an essential process in the transformation of gender \nrelations because it addresses the structural and underlying caus es of subordination and \ndiscrimination.  \nEquality of \nOpportunity  Refers to a fundamental human right, and a zero tolerance to discrimination, as \nembedded in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. At the core of this \nNational Gender Policy is achieving equal opportunity for ALL irrespective of sex, \ngender, and social circumstance , such that everybody has equal access to resources, \nservices, employment opportunities among others.  \nEquality of \nTreatment  Refers to meeting the specific and distinc t needs of different social categories of men \nand women by government and cultural institutions, service providers, and employers \nof labour irrespective of sex, gender, and physical disabilities. Equality of treatment \ndoes not mean treating all men and wom en in exactly the same way (i.e., in a gender -\nblind fashion) as this would only serve to perpetuate existing disparities, rather persons \nare treated according to the level of need and/or social circumstance.  \nGender  This refers to culturally and socially constructed roles, responsibilities, privileges, \nrelations and expectations assigned to being women, men, boys and girls. Gender is \ntherefore patterned, socially produced distinctions between femininity and masculinity. \nIt is a central organising principle  of societies, and often governs the processes of \nproduction and reproduction, consumption and distribution.  Through gendered \nprocesses, advantages and disadvantages, exploitation and control, action and emotion, \nmeaning, and identity are patterned in ter ms of a distinction between male and female; \nmasculinity and femininity. Thus, gender attributes are culturally specific (not \nuniversal), and can change over a period of time. They do not necessarily have \nbiological component.  \nGender Analysis  \u201cIs a proces s which allows us to distinguish the ways in which the distribution of \nresources, activities, power, representation and decision -making vary amongst women \nand men within a given socio -economic group and at a particular point in time.  A \ngender analysis may  ask typical questions such as \u2013 who does what? Who has what? \nWho decides? How? Who sins? Who loses?\u201d (The United Nations System in Nigeria, \n2013:12).  \nGender and \nDevelopment \n(GAD)  Refers to a planning process which is based on an analysis of the different  situations \nand needs of men, women, boys and girls. It aims at creating gender equity between \nmen and women; boys and girls. A gender and development perspective recognises the \nimportance of the relations between men and women; boys and girls.  \nGender \nAwa reness  Refers to a state of knowledge of the differences in roles and relations of women and \nmen; girls and boys; and how this results in difference in power relations, status, \nprivilege and needs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 4062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7360cd4c-dae2-42a2-b5a5-09a2eb8aa221": {"__data__": {"id_": "7360cd4c-dae2-42a2-b5a5-09a2eb8aa221", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29d0d0b1-0c5b-4a7b-a755-b7517c28f4f2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\NATIONAL-GENDER-POLICY.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3039948, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "03435b8c52bb0bebdcba56be60ad2a57e8bb20cbc67d20c73e6712e2260db966", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NATIONAL GENDER POLICY NOT NATION GENDER POLICY  \n Gender aware \npolicy appraisal  Is a tool that assesses whether the policy addresses the needs of men and women; boys \nand girls; and specific vulnerable groups such as the physically challenged and the \naged.  \n \nGender Bias  This is a positive and/or negative attitudes/practices towards ei ther female or male.  \n \nGender \nBlindness  Is the failure to recognise that gender is an essential determinant of social outcomes \nimpacting on projects and policies. A gender -blind approach assumes that gender is not \nan influencing factor in, projects, progra ms or policy. Such policy/programme/project \nconsciously or unconsciously failed to consider the position, needs, feelings, and \ndesires of women, men, boy and girls as separate categories with separate needs and \ninterests. For example, until recently, agric ulture policies are male biased - as \n\u201cfarmers\u201d are generally seen as males, while female farmers are often not focused in \nagricultural intervention programmes.   This ends up widening the gender gap in \nAgriculture.  \nGender Budget  A budgeting method that analyses the incidence of budgets on men and women and \ngirls and boys. Gender budgeting entails analyses of revenue and expenditure impacts \nso as to avoid or correct gender imbalances. Gender budgeting or \u2018gender -sensitive \nbudgets\u2019 are not separate budgets  for women, or for men; rather it is a dissection of the \ngovernment budget to establish its gender -differential impacts and to translate gender \ncommitments into budgetary commitments. The main objective of a gender -sensitive \nbudget is to improve the analys is of incidence of budgets, attain more effective \ntargeting of public expenditure and offset any undesirable gender -specific \nconsequences of previous budgetary measures.  \nGender \nDevelopment \nIndex (GDI)  Refers to an index which uses some  of the same variabl es as the Human Development \nIndex (HDI) which includes life expectancy, educational attainment and real GDP, but \nwhich goes further to take into account inequality in achievement between women and \nmen; boys and girls.  \nGender \nDiscrimination  Differential tr eatment to individuals on the grounds of gender  \n \nGender Division \nof Labour  Different work roles assigned by society to men and women. For example, women tend \nto be engaged in unpaid domestic work, low pay, low status and informal sector jobs, \nwhile men te nd to be employed in higher paid and formal sector work.  \nGender \nEmpowerment \n(GEM)  Refers to a  measure which examines whether women and men are able to actively \nparticipate in social, economic, and political life and are able to take part in decision -\nmakin g. GEM  focuses on the   capacities of women and men to take advantage of the \nopportunities of life.  \nGender Equality  Refers to a situation where women and men have equal conditions for realizing their \nfull human rights and potential; are able to contribute  equally to national, political, \neconomic, social and cultural development; and benefit equally from the results. \nGender Equality entails that the underlying causes of discrimination based on sex, \ngender and other social conditions are systematically ident ified and removed in order to \ngive men and women equal opportunities. The concept of Gender Equality, as used in \nthis policy framework, takes into account women existing subordinate positions within \nsocial relations and aims at the structuring of society s o as to eradicate male \ndomination. Therefore, equality is understood to include both formal equality and \nsubstantive equality; not merely simple equality to men. Gender equality tends to refer \nto equality in outcomes and results.  \nGender Equity  This entail s the provision of fairness and justice in the distribution of benefits and \nresponsibilities between women and men; boys and girls. The concept recognises that \nwomen and men; boys and girls, have different needs and power and that these \ndifferences should be identified and addressed in a manner that rectifies the imbalances \nbetween the sexes.

Though \nsome gender gaps are controversial, they are not to be confused with sexist stereotypes. \nA classic example of a gende r gap is the supposed difference in pay between men and \nwomen for the same job responsibilities. The European Commission defines gender \ngap as the \u2018gap in any area between women and men in terms of their levels of \nparticipation, access, rights, remuneratio n or benefits\u2019 (European Commission, 1998).  \nGender Implicit \nIssues  These are not clearly state, they are hidden, henceforth implied, such terms as farmers, \npopulation, the poor, and the masses are given examples.  Therefore, there is need to \nopen them up and know exactly whose gender needs are being targeted.  Is it men, \nwomen, girls or boys?  \nGender \nIndicator  It measures gender related changes in society over time. They may be pointers, facts, \nnumbers, opinions or perceptions used to signify changes in sp ecific conditions or \nprogress towards particular gender -related objectives (The United Nations in Nigeria, \n2013)  \nGender Issues  These arise when the relationships between women and men, their roles, privileges, \nstatus and positions are identified and analysed. Gender issues arise where inequalities \nare shown to exist between people purely on the basis of being a female or a male. The \nfact that gender differences are socially constructed is itself a primary issue to deal \nwith.  \nGender \nMainstreaming  Main streaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for \nwomen and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, \nin any area and at all levels.  It is a strategy for making women\u2019s as well as men\u2019s \nconcern s and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation of the policies and programmes in all political, economic \nand societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally, and inequality is not \nperpetuated (ECOSOC , 1997).  \n \nRecognising that most institutions consciously and unconsciously serve the interests of \nmen, gender mainstreaming perspective aims at transforming institutions to promote \nfull participation of women in decision making so that women\u2019s needs move from the \nmargins to the centre of development planning and resource allocation.  \nGender \nManagement \nSystem (GMS)  GMS is a network of structures, mechanisms and processes put in place within an \nexisting organisational framework, to guide, plan, monitor and e valuate the process of \nmainstreaming gender into all areas of the organisation\u2019s work, in order to achieve \ngreater gender equality and equity within the context of sustainable development \n(Commonwealth Secretariat, 1990).  \nGender Neutral  The planning for w omen, men, girls and boys as if they are homogeneous and not \ntaking into consideration their different needs and roles.  Experience has shown that \ngender neutral planning in reality addresses the needs of the dominant group.  \nGender \nOppression  Whereby one gender dominates the other unjustly or even cruelly, whether it is \ndeliberate or not.  \nGender \nPerspective  The ultimate goal of this approach is to create equality between women and men. It \nuses a set of tools and guidelines on how to identify the impact on  development on \ngender relations and the roles of women and men.  \nGender re -\ndistributive \npolicies  These policies try to tackle gender imbalances, gender gaps and gender disparities in \nsociety by addressing the strategic gender needs of both men and women.  Such \npolicies transform gender relationships and lead to gender equality.  \nGender \nResponsiveness  Refers to a planning process in which programmes and policy actions are developed to \ndeal with and counteract problems which arise out of socially constructed  differences \nbetween women and men.  \nGender Roles  These are the different tasks and responsibilities and expectations that society has \ndefined and allocated to men, women, girls and boys.

The HDI focuses on three variable s, namely life expectancy, educational \nattainment and the gross domestic product (GDP ). \nPolicy  Refers to guiding principles to a course of action arrived at by decision -makers to \naddress an area of concern and/or issues through executive and/or legal acti on. \nPoverty  Poverty is a level of economic development, which barely meets the minimum \nstandards of human wellbeing. Conventional economic definitions use income or \nconsumption pattern, complemented by a range of other social indicators such as life \nexpec tancy, infant mortality, nutrition, the proportion of the household budget spent on \nfood, literacy, school enrolment rates, access to health clinics or drinking water; to \nclassify poor groups against a common index of material welfare.  \nPractical \nGender Ne eds \n(PGN)  PGNs are needs which are related to satisfying both men\u2019s and women\u2019s, girls\u2019 and \nboys\u2019 basic and material needs for their day today survival.  Women\u2019s PGNs are those \nneeds identified to help women cope better in their existing subordinate positions. \nThus,  practical needs are related largely to issues of welfare and do not challenge the \nexisting gender division of labour and/or improve women\u2019s subordinate positions in \nsociety.  \nProductive \nactivities  Refers to the production of goods and services for consumption or trade.  When people \nare asked what they do for a living, the response is usually related to productive work, \nespecially work that generates income.  Both men and women are involved in \nproductive activities but, for the most part, their funct ions and responsibilities will \ndiffer according to gender division of labour in the society.  Women\u2019s productive work \nis often less visible and less valued than men.  \nReproductive \nwork  Refers to care and maintenance of the household and its members \u2013 inclu ding child \nbearing and nurturing roles, preparing food, collecting water and fuel, shopping, \nhousekeeping and family health care.  Although reproductive work is crucial to human \nsurvival, it is seldom considered \u201creal work\u201d.  Reproductive work is usually t ime \nconsuming, labour intensive and not paid for.  It is almost always the responsibility of \nwomen and girls.  \nSex This is the biological make up of men and women, boys, and girls which describes their \nanatomical distinction of being a male or a female.

Meeting strategic needs help s women \nto achieve greater Gender Equality.   It also changes existing roles and therefore \nchallenges the structure of gender inequality which often results in women\u2019s \nsubordinate position.  Strategic needs may include such issues as legal rights, equal \nwage, and women\u2019s control over resources among others.  \nSubstantive \nEquality  Refers to a stage of real equality underpinned by equality of opportunity, access and \ntreatment between women and men.  \nWomen \nEmpowerment  This is a process of generating and buildin g capacities to exercise control over one\u2019s \nlife. Empowerment is the process of increasing the capacity of individuals or groups to \nmake choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes. Central \nto this process are actions which bot h build individual and collective assets, and \nimprove the efficiency and fairness of the organisational and institutional context \nwhich govern the use of these assets.  \nWomen in \nDevelopment \n(WID)  Refers to a planning process in which the importance of wom en\u2019s needs in \ndevelopment is the major focus.

The campaign commenced on 25 November 2020 \nwith the celebration of the International Day on Elimination of Violence against Women and Girls \n(VAWG) in the 36 States of the Federation including the FCT. \nDuring the 16 days period, the Commission in collaboration with stakeholders, including the \nNigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), embarked on \nawareness creation activities, visited the legislative, judiciary and executive arms of government \nand some governance institutions including health facilities. Across the States, it was found that \nthere is several violence perpetrated against women and girls, based on their ascribed gender . Such \nviolence includes, but not limited to sexual violence, physical and psychological assaults, \ndeprivation of economic power and resources, denial of access to children, neglect of women by \ntheir intimate partners, harmful cultural/traditional practices (including widowhood practices), \nfemale genital mutilation, the almajiri socio-cultural practice (particularly in the Northern part of \nNigeria). Most of the violence go unreported or under -reported due to stigma or fear of reprisal.\nAt the end of the 16 days of activism, on 10 December , marking the commemoration of the \nInternational Human Rights Day, the Commission, and its partners, issued communiques. The \nCommuniques called on the governments of the various States to take positive steps towards ending \nviolence against women and girls, ensure the domestication of the VAPP Act in the States and \naccountability for victims. The Commission further committed to, throughout the 2020/2021 cycle, \nembark on awareness and sensitisation, including advocacy for legislation that will oust the \nviolence and harmful practices against women and girls.\nMethodology \nDuring the 16 days of activism, the Commission engaged in advocacy with both state and non-state \nactors. It raised awareness on the rights of women to a violent free society , promulgation of States to \npass laws to outlaw harmful traditional practices against women and girls, hold perpetrators \naccountable, develop policies that seek to protect women and girls and take a stand against SGBV .\nThe Commission, through its State O\ufb03ces, organized rallies, roundtable discussions with \nstakeholders, including the Nigerian Bar Association, Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), \nCSOs, NGOs, governance institutions, religious and traditional institutions as well as women and \nyouth's groups.

To commemorate the 2020 16 days of activism, the Commission \nembarked on various activities, aimed at creating awareness, sensitizing the public, and advocating \nfor end to violence against women and girls, under the 2020 global theme \u2013 \u201cOrange the World: \nFund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!\u201d . \nGlobally , there have been increased reports on violence against women and girls, which was \nexacerbated by the lockdown introduced across countries to curb the spread of the COVID-19 \npandemic. Nigeria was no less a\ufb00ected as the Commission was inundated with reports of various \nforms of violence against women and girls, such as rape, domestic violence (assault and battery), \nand other forms of harmful practices, prompting the need to create awareness and sensitize the \ncitizens on SGBV . Su\ufb03ce to say that between March and June 2020, the Commission received more \nthan 232 reports on sexual and gender -based violence (SGBV), while the Nigerian Police Force \nreportedly received about 799 cases of rape from across the 36 States of Nigeria, including the \nFederal Capital Territory . These reports and the numbers recorded indicate that there is no one state \nthat is immune from the global violence against women and girls. \nWomen and girls experience various forms of Gender Based Violence (GBV) notwithstanding that \nConstitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended as well as extant legislation \nguarantee the respect and enforcement of the rights of the citizenry and sanctity of human life.\nFurthermore, Nigeria is a party to all major regional and international human rights instruments \nincluding but not limited to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention \nAgainst Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and degrading Treatment and Punishment, the Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Mapotu Protocol. \nMost forms of violence experienced by women and girls include rape, domestic violence, \nforced/early marriage, harmful traditional practices (including widowhood practices and denial of \ninheritance), physical assault, sexual assault and female genital mutilation, among other human \nrights violations. One of the main contributing factors to gender -based violence is the deliberate \nmisunderstanding of women and girls' human rights, and the generalized society's approval of \ncultural practices and attitudes that violate women and girls' rights.\nThese abuses are perpetrated with impunity and few of the perpetrators are held accountable for the \nabuse. One of the challenges faced in addressing these abuses is inadequate information and late \nreporting to relevant authorities which inhibits e\ufb00ective redress on behalf of victims/survivors. This \nmay not be unconnected with societal tolerance or complicity of family members, neighbours or \nother persons who may engage in reprisal attacks. It is sad to mention that even for the abuses that \nare reported, the police or relevant authorities maintain a \u201cnon-interference\u201d approach in order not \nto be seen as responsible for marriage break up or causing family problems.\nIt is appalling that this phenomenon continues to a\ufb00ect women and girls at the time that Nigeria is \npart of the global call for action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals where no \none is left behind towards achieving an all-inclusive action against inequality , poverty , security and \nclimate change.

Overview and scope of violence against women and girls in Nigeria\nIn Nigeria, violence against women has taken a crisis dimension which was exacerbated by the \nCorona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic that hit the world in January 2020, and declaration of global \npandemic in March 2020. This led to lockdowns, closure of businesses and loss of earnings. With \nthe lockdown, more reports on violence against women and girls were recorded. \nThe Commission, between March and June, received and treated about 232 cases from across the \ncountry . These include cases of rape and attempted rape of both adult and minor females, physical \nassault, forced and early marriages, emotional trauma/abuses, denial of livelihood etc. Besides the \nviolence that came to the fore due to the lockdown, there were reported cases of harmful traditional \npractices such as denial of inheritance rights, widowhood practices, survival sex, tra\ufb03cking, early \nand forced marriages, forced prostitution, exploitation for accommodation, female genital \nmutilation, among others.\nThis assessment therefore seeks to highlight the pattern of violence that are perpetrated against \nwomen and girls, the facilities available to respond to the violence, the available laws and policies \nacross the 36 States of the federation including the FCT.\n1.2. Overview of the Legal instruments and policies against violence against women\nNigeria is a party to core regional and international human rights instruments including the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Convention Against \nTorture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment, Convention on the Elimination \nof All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights \nand the Maputo Protocol.\nThe domestic framework for the protection of the rights of women and the girl child is predicated on \nthe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, the VAAP  Act 2015, ACJA  \n2015, the Penal Code, Criminal Code and the Child Rights Act 2003.\nBesides the laws, there are policies and programmes which have been formulated to protect women \nand girls from violence. At the National level, the policies include the National Gender Policy , \nNational Action Plan for the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325 and Related Resolutions in \nNigeria and the National Policy and Action Plan for the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation in \nNigeria\n In Lagos State, there is the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team under the auspices of \nMinistry of Justice set up to ensure a coordinated community response to domestic and sexual \nviolence. The framework is a deliberate policy on the part of the Lagos State government, consisting \nstate and non- state actors, providing response services within the state, to ensure the protection of \nsurvivors, through a coordinated response by service providers. \nIn most of the other States, there is the Sexual Assault and Referral Centers (SARC), where \nsurvivors meet professional, have safe space to tell their story and be attended to by professional \ntrained to o\ufb00ers medical, legal, economic, and psychosocial supports.

In addition, violence against \nwomen and girls is an act of gender -based violence, resulting in or likely to result in physical, menta \nand sexual su\ufb00erings to women and girls. It may include the act of coercion, threats, arbitrary \ndeprivation of liberty , as well as violation of right to dignity . Violence against women and girls is a \nworldwide menace, which has been described by the WHO as a problem that a\ufb00ects the health \nstatus of women and girls, their reproductive health, economic and social powers as well as \nemotional state.\nWhile it is widely believed that violence against women and girls (VAWG) is perpetrated by their \nmale counter parts, in some parts of Nigeria, VAWG is perpetrated by both males and females based \non the patriarchal society . The females that perpetrate the violence against men believe they are \nmerely implementing the \u201ctraditional and cultural teachings, which has been handed down from \ngeneration to generation\u201d, of the sub-ordination of women to men, given the patriarchal nature of \nNigerian societies. \nThe Nigerian society is a patriarchal society with a structure which justi\ufb01es violence against \nwomen and girls, while in some societies, it is seen as a tool used to discipline the female gender . \nFor instance, in the South East, the \u201cUmu-Ada\u201d are the daughters of the linage or community \nmarried, single or separated, who often take up the role of ensuring that their female counters obey \nthe customs and culture of the society , especially in de\ufb01ning the role of a woman within that society . \nIn the South-South, among the Kalabari in Rivers State, E\ufb01k in Cross River and Ibibios in Akwa \nIbom State, there is the traditional \u201cfattening Room\u201d, where maidens are kept in separate homes for \nupward of three months, and some elderly women teach the maidens how to be 'good wives' to their \nhusbands, they are taught marriage etiquettes, acceptable social behaviours and custom. \nAcceptance into the fattening room is viewed as possessing virtues, sexual purity , and proven \nvirginity . \nIn the Northern part of the country , women are admonished by the culture to be submissive to their \nhusbands and any male counterpart. The women in the family ensures that this aspect of the culture \nis upheld and ostracizes the female child or their female counterparts who dares to question the \nstatus quo.\nThe patriarchal structure is embedded in tradition, culture and religion practiced by the people. This \nis further emboldened by religious and traditional leaders which perpetrate this violence by \nensuring that the female in the society respect it to the later or are stigmatized and labelled 'rebels.' \nWomen and girls are perceived as second to their male counterparts and must obey the male \ncounterparts. 2.0.

The common issues that cut across all the States are \u2013 sexual violence (rape or \nattempted rape), battery/physical assault, denial of livelihood, deprivation of economic powers, \nde\ufb01lement, and tra\ufb03cking.  Others are Acid bathing, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), forced and \nearly marriage, child betrothal, harmful traditional practices, survival sex (forced prostitution).\nSome States have peculiar violations that take place within the states, due to their cultural bias. In \nthe Northern States, besides the aforementioned violence, there was identi\ufb01ed early and forced \nmarriages, child prostitution and phonography , survival sex, exploitation for accommodation. \n(peculiar in Adamawa State), sodomy (kano State). In the South East, there is the practice of \nharmful widowhood practices, reproductive coercion and forced prostitution (Sexual Slavery) etc.\n2.1. Sexual Violence (SV) \nSexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments, or \nadvances, or acts to tra\ufb03c, or otherwise, directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion/force, \nby any person, regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including, but not limited \nto home and work. Apart from physical force, it may involve psychological intimidation, \nblackmail, or other threats \u2013 for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job, \nor of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person being targeted is unable to \ngive consent \u2013 for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding \nthe situation. Sexual violence includes rape, de\ufb01ned as physically forced or otherwise coerced \npenetration \u2013 even if slight \u2013 of the vulva or anus, or any opening, using a penis, other body parts or \nan object. The attempt has forces sexual act, without penetration is referred to as attempted rape. \nRape can be committed by a single perpetrator or more. \nSexual violence may take place in peace time, con\ufb02ict, or post con\ufb02ict situations. It undermines a \nperson's sexual or gender integrity and violates human rights, particularly the freedom from cruel \ninhuman and degrading treatment, dignity , private life, freedom from discrimination and right to \nhealth, among others. In situations of con\ufb02ict, as it is in the North East, sexual violence is \nsometimes used as a weapon of war, causing the victims and the community , or opposing side \nsevere pain and su\ufb00ering. It is perpetrated against individuals or group of individuals to force them \nto divulge information or to conquer them.\n According to the 2020 UN Secretary General Annual Report on Children and Armed Con\ufb02ict, \nsexual violence perpetrated by Boko Haram a\ufb00ected 30 girls, between the ages of 12 and 16, \nincluding 23 who were abducted and subsequently raped or forcibly married to Boko Haram \nelements. \nOften survivors of sexual violence are stigmatized and sometimes ostracized from the community . \nThey are made to feel shamed and often blame themselves for what had happened to them. They \nfeel less human and are may be prone to psychological and emotional trauma, are suicidal and \nchildren born out of rape are rejected by the community as well. \nSV has impact on the physical and mental health of survivors, causes severe injuries (physical or \nemotional), and it is linked with increased risk of a range of sexual and reproductive health \nproblems, with both immediate and long-term consequences.

For instance, between April and June 2020, the \nSocial Media as well as the traditional media was agog with calls for justice of victims of rape. For \nexample, there was the call for justice for Jennifer , who was reportedly gangraped by \ufb01ve boys in \nKaduna State on 27 April 2020, by some boys who, reportedly , are familiar to her.

Would you be satis\ufb01ed?\u201d and so on. \nIn some cases, the women are bold enough to seek redress, not from the law enforcement agents, but \nfrom quasi-judicial system, seeking mediation and reconciliation rather than punitive justice. For \ninstance, Plateau State recorded 283 reported cases of domestic violence between January and \nDecember 2020 reported to the Commission and some CSO partners focusing on SGBV .\nDuring the period of review , some form of domestic violence reported in Nigeria are herein stated \n i. Battery and Physical Assault:  \nWife battery and assault are reported as the most common act of violence against women and girls \nacross the States. According to reports from the di\ufb00erent States of the Federation, wife battery and \nassault is reportedly so common to the extent that it viewed by both victims, perpetrators, and \nsecurity personnel as a way of living. Beating a woman is allowed in most cultures as a way of \ndisciplining and admonishing her for being recalcitrant. It is viewed as too trivial an issue to the \nextent that law enforcement agents in the State hardly regard it as a case to be investigated when \nreported and the society ask the question \u2013 \u201cwhat did you do? You will not obey your husband\u201d. For \ninstance, Taraba State reported 71 cases of assault on women between January and December 2020. \n ii. Family abandonment and neglect\nAcross the country , it was reported that there are various cases of the male members of the families \nabandoning their wives and leaving them to fend for the children. This is reported to be another \nform of violence, su\ufb00ered by women, exacerbated by the lockdown, due to the Corona Virus \npandemic and loose of livelihoods. These practice most often go unreported, as the woman views it \nas her responsibility to ensure that the children of the marriage/union or her o\ufb00spring do not su\ufb00er \nneglect. The act has reportedly caused trauma and exposed women to various form of human rights \nabuses and violation. Some have reportedly been forced into prostitution to fend for their families, \nor the girls in the family hawk or prostitute to fend for her siblings.

Yobe State \nreported about 110 girls on the street of Yobe, hawking to support their families. Y obe State, 22 \ncases and Taraba State reported 11 cases of family abandonment were reported, while Plateau State \nrecorded 196.\nThe tale is not di\ufb00erent in the South, where the girl child is forced to fend for the family that have \nbeen abandoned by the father . For instance, Bayelsa State reportedly recorded four (4) families \nreporting cases of abandonment in 2020. \n2.3.  Harmful practices\nHarmful practices vary across Nigeria and it is prevalent, despite the provision of the Constitution \nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, the Child Rights Act/Laws, V APP Act/Laws, and other \nlegal provisions and human rights instruments, prohibiting practices that may lead to deprivation of \nhuman rights and are discriminatory in terms of race, gender , or circumstances of birth. Harmful \npractices violate the right to freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and \npunishment, right to dignity and freedom from discrimination. The Committee on discrimination \nagainst women and committee on the rights of the child states that harmful traditional practices are \ndeeply rooted in social attitudes that regards women and girls as inferior to men and boys. It puts \nwomen and girls at risk, a\ufb00ects their reproductive health and their dignity . \ni. Harmful widowhood practices\nIn Nigeria, harmful traditional practices include widowhood practices where the female is made to \nunder go certain practices such as forced to shave her hair, seat on the \ufb02oor or on mat thrown on the \n\ufb02oor, wear black or white cloth, or sleep in the same room as the corpse of her husband is lying in \nstate, to prove that he loves him or that she was not responsible for his dead. Though some of these \ntraditional practices has waned with the passing of time, it is still being practiced in some areas, \ngiven that there are cultural practices. Most of the States reported cases of harmful widowhood \npractices, however , since it is believed that it is a cultural practice in honour of a late husband, it is \ngrossly under reported. Plateau State O\ufb03ce reported 14 cases of widowhood practices. \nii. Denial of female inheritance\nAnother form of harmful traditional practices is denial of female inheritance. The father or husband \npasses, the family of the man ensures that the wife and female children have nothing from the man's \nestate. It made worst when the woman has no male child for the late husband. She is striped of the \nproperty and left alone to fend for the daughters. In other instance, denial of the females the right to \nowning landed properties, right to education, the right to reproductive choices, freedom of choice \nand expressions. Harmful practices are the root cause of early and forced marriages, FGM, and \nperpetrates violence against women and girls. From Plateau State, the Commission and its partners \nreported 13 cases of various harmful traditional practices, including denial of access to property \npractices and 38 cases of disinheritance.\niii. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\nThe FGM is a traditional practice in most parts of Nigeria, where the clitoris is cut by some \ncommissioned males or females in the community where it is practiced. According to widely held \nmyth, female circumcision reduces promiscuity in the female child thus preventing her bringing \nshame to the family .

The unhygienic method in which it is conducted may lead to some infections and a\ufb00ects \nthe reproductive system of the females. During the period under review , it was reported that in Yobe \nState, 3 female minors were circumcised in 2020. Other states reported the practices, but no \ufb01gure is \ngiven.  The practice is still going on, despite concerted e\ufb00orts to outlaw it by advocacy and laws . \nFor instance, VAPP Act 2015 prohibits FGM and prescribed punishment for any perpetrator as \nfollows: \nSection 6 of the VAPP Act prohibits FGM and provides for set of punishments for FGM, including: \n1. The circumcision or genital mutilation of the girl child or woman is hereby \nprohibited.'\n2.

Anybody who attempts, aids, abets, or incites another to carry out FGM is liable \nto a term not exceeding 2 years imprisonment or to a \ufb01ne not exceeding N100,000 \nor to both\nHowever , VAPP is not applicable in all states of Nigeria, except FCT, because of the federal system \nof government, and most States are yet to pass VAPP into law. According to reports from across the \nCountry , the practice is ongoing but never reported. These is principally as a result of the laws \nprohibiting the practices in most of the States and in some cases viewing the act as a cultural \npractice that must be performed. However , Yobe State reported 2 cases, which came to the fore.\nDue to the awareness created around the practices of FGM and the use of traditional circumcisers, \nwith non-sterilized objects to perform FGM, and outlawing it in some states by Law, it has been \nfound that some communities or parents are working at medicalizing the practice. Dr Chris \nAimakhu an obstetrician and gynaecologist (OB/GYN) and the Secretary General of Society of \nGynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON), was reported to have stated that it has become a \npractice sought by parents. He said, \u201cYou'd be surprised that some parents pay health workers as \nmuch as US$100 to circumcise their female child\u201d.  He reiterated that there is no health bene\ufb01t of \nFGM, rather it is humiliating, and poses serious health threat such as tetanus infections, excessive \nbleeding, urinary problems and in some cases, death. WHO is reportedly working with the Federal \nGovernment to stop the medicalization of FGM, as in the context of universal health coverage and \nhuman rights under the SDG 2030, mandate that stakeholders address FGM regardless of \nindividual circumstances, cultural or social norms. \niv. Early/for ced marriage \nMarriage is viewed as a union between two consenting adults. In Nigeria, marriages are conducted \nunder three legal systems, customary (traditional), Islamic and statutory marriages. In all three, it is \nexpected that it will be a union between two consenting adults, however in some parts of Nigeria, \nearly and forced marriage is prevalent. Girls who are de\ufb01ned under the law as legal minors are \nforced to get married, either for economic reasons or cultural beliefs that once a girl, not minding \nthe age from birth starts menstruating, she is matured enough to be married. In some instances, the \nstance is that early marriages reduce the chances of promiscuity , and bringing \u201cshame to the \nfamily\u201d, it is a means of \u201csocial integration\u201d, \u201cwellbeing and religious beliefs\u201d.

In Yobe State, there were reported 4 cases of \nearly marriages, that occurred in one of the IDP camps, while in Taraba State, 2 cases were recorded. \nThe \ufb01nding from Bauchi state indicated that early marriage is prevalent, and it is attributed to \nreligious or cultural beliefs, abuse of power , poverty , ignorance, and inadequate and or poor \nimplementation of laws, where there exist. \n2.4.  Human/female tra\ufb03cking \nTra\ufb03cking in women and girls has contributed to forms of gender -based violence and human right \nabuses. Women and girls are tra\ufb03cked through the porous borders through Niger Republic in a bid \nto get to Europe. For instance, most of the States in the North borders Niger Republic and serves as \none of the routes to Europe, providing an avenue for moving women and girls for economic gain. \nFrom Yobe State, victims are moved through Damaturu to Niger Republic and subsequently to \nEurope.  From the South, the girls are taken all the way through these Northern States to Niger on \ntheir way to Europe. Some are taken through the airports, with arranged passports and \u201cwork \npermits\u201d, for sexual exploitation or cheap labour .\nIn some cases, girls are tra\ufb03cked from the rural areas to urban areas to serve as domestic sta\ufb00 or \ncheap labour in factories or small businesses. The causes of tra\ufb03cking include poverty , desperation \nto escape violence, corruption, unemployment, illiteracy , and ignorance etc. \n2.5.  Infanticide and Stigmatization\nDuring the 16 days of activism, the Commission was informed that some communities in the FCT \npractice infanticide, as they view the birth of twins as a cultural taboo. The woman who gives birth \nis reportedly cleansed and the children killed to abate curses. Children, mostly girl child, are labeled \nwitches and stigmatized, denied access to critical human rights like education, health, freedom \nfrom discrimination, freedom of association, freedom from torture, etc. Despite being a growing \ncontributory factor to human rights abuses, witchcraft stigmatization has historically received little \nattention within the human rights discourse, largely as a result of a combination of lack of \nawareness concerning its existence.\nSurvivors of rape and SGBV  are often stigmatized. They are made to feel guilty and often re-\ntraumatised, made to withdraw from the society and unwanted. In some cases, they are ostracized \nfrom their peer groups or associations. In some instances, stigmatization has led to suicide and \nmental health challenges.\n2.6.  Educational Inequality/Almajiri System\nWomen and girls are mostly disadvantaged in access to education, across the country . The girl child \nis made to stay at home and take care of her sibling while the male is sent to school. She is \nwithdrawn from school, when her mother , brothers, grandparents, or any member of the family is \nill, so she can provide care.

She \nis either bullied in school or told at home that she is matured enough to be married. She is therefore \nwithdrawn and given out in marriage to a man that may be twice her age.

The damage may be physical, psychological or both. It may \nbe intentional and used against a person leading to either physical or mental harm. It a\ufb00ects the \nvictim in several ways and can be classi\ufb01ed as violation of the rights to freedom from cruel and \ninhuman treatments. Violence Prevention Alliance (VPA) de\ufb01ne violence as \u201cthe intentional use of \nforce or power , threatened or actual, against oneself another person or against a group or community \nthat results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury , death, psychological harm, \nmaldevelopment or deprivation\u201d. \nDeriving from above, violence against women and girls can be classi\ufb01ed as an intentional use of \nforce or power against women and girls on the basis of their sex, with the likelihood of causing them \neither physical or psychological harm. In most cases, violence has had devastating e\ufb00ect of women \nand girls across the globe. According to WHO report on \u201cViolence Against W omen: Key Facts\u201d, \nviolence against women and girls is particularly committed by intimate partners, it's a public health \nproblem and violates the rights of women; 1 in 3 (35%) of women globally have su\ufb00ered from one \nform of violence or the other , while 38% have been killed by either their intimate partners or family . \nViolence negatively a\ufb00ects women physically , mentally , sexual, and reproductive health, and \nincreases their chances of being infected by diseases such as Sexually Transmitted \nDiseases/Infections such as HIV etc. The perpetrators are most likely to be males, but in some \nclime, females also perpetrate violence against their fellow females as the tradition may dictate.\nNigeria is not left out in these statistics of the number of violence perpetrated against women and \ngirls. It has been found from interaction with stakeholders that the rate of violence against women \nand girls in Nigeria reached its peak during the COVID-19 lockdown. Between March and June \n2020, the Commission received about 232 cases of violence against women and girls, ranging from \nphysical to psychological violence and denial of economic powers.\n3.1. Physical harm/serious injuries\nPhysical harm is referred to as a non-accidental trauma, injury in\ufb02icted on a person, that may result \nin death, permanent or temporary disability , inadequate nourishment, illness, or dis\ufb01gurement. It \ncan take either the form of hitting, strangulation, acid bathing, deprivation of nourishment etc. \nAccording to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Women's A\ufb00airs and Social Development \nsupported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF A) and Norwegian Government, 28% of \nthe Nigerian women aged 25 \u2013 29 have experienced some form of physical violence since at the age \nof 15, while 15% of women experienced physical violence, the survey further reported that the level \nof exposure to the risk of violence varied based on marital status and that 44% of divorced, \nseparated or widowed women reported experiencing violence since at age 15, while 25% of married \nwomen or those living with their spouses have experienced violence . \nThe brutality and violence employed by perpetrators of rape has often left the victims with serious \ninjuries and resulted in medical complications, particularly among young girls, elderly women and \neven women in marriages. In some cases, injuries or infections resulting from rape has led to death. \nCommon form of physical harm from sexual violence reportedly encountered by survivors are \nvaginal tearing, laceration, injury to the cervices, fractured bones, vaginal \ufb01stula (VVF), and \ndamage to reproductive system. For pregnant victims, there are at risk of miscarriage, pre-term \nlabour , and injury to the fetus. \nIn 2020, Adamawa State recorded about 200 cases of VVF , 111 cases were successfully treated in 3.0.

However , the scar remains with the victims, who in \nsome cases are stigmatized and abandoned by families. There are also injuries like rapture of \nwombs or spine cord injury in underage girls getting pregnant and unable to carry the pregnancy or \nfrom prolonged labour . \nIn addition, Jos Plateau State, two hundred and eighty-three (283) cases of domestic violence \nleading to one form of physical harm or the other was recorded between January and November \n2020, while Yobe State reported 12 recorded cases of physical harm and trauma.\n3.2. Death\nDeath may occur in some instances of SGBV , due to the brutality employed by perpetrators, \nespecially rape or assault. In some of the States, there have been reported death, resulting from the \ne\ufb00ects of sexual or gender -based violence. However , such situations are under reported. For \ninstance, it was reported that in Yobe State, one minor , died after trying to procure illegal abortion, \nwhen she realized that she was pregnant after being raped.  In Benin, Edo State, a 22-year -old was \nraped and killed, in Ibadan, Oyo State, an 18-year -old was also raped to death, while in Bayelsa \nState, it was reported that 4 women were killed by their partners as a result of violence, and 1 \nattempted murder was reported.\n3.3. Trauma \nThe mental health consequences of rape can be severe and long-lasting on the survivor . SGBV  \nleaves lasting trauma on survivors be it psychological, emotional, or physical and the survivor may \nstruggle with depression and a range of other psychological and mental challenges facing higher \nrisk for suicide. These challenges may deny survivors from reaching their full potential and \ncontributing to the well-being of the community . Due to the trauma associated with sexual violence \nparticularly , most women henceforth recoil and attempts at getting intimate bring back waves of \nmemories, thus a\ufb00ecting their sexual lives.\nMental health and psychosocial support service providers reported that there is insu\ufb03cient mental \nhealth care in Nigeria. Many survivors are likely su\ufb00ering from untreated symptoms of conditions \nincluding post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety . The symptoms of these \nconditions may include social withdrawal, feelings of shame and hopelessness, di\ufb03culty \nconcentrating, nightmares, \ufb02ashbacks, anxiety and panic attacks, and acts of self-harm, including \nsuicide. Because of the social stigma associated with mental health in Nigeria, most survivors do \nnot seek assistance and when they do, they are stigmatised by either families or community , labelled \nas \u201cmad\u201d and or \u201ccursed\u201d. In the background of Nigeria, were there has been con\ufb02ict and insecurity , \nsexual violence has been used to tear apart the social fabric of families and communities, and to \nin\ufb02ict individual and collective trauma.\nDespite the mental e\ufb00ect of SGBV  on survivors, there is a gap in the provision of mental health in \nNigeria. In Plateau State for instance, it was reported that only two Non-Governmental \nOrganisations, present in the metropolis has trained personnel and facilities to o\ufb00er trauma support \nto survivors, while in most other states there are no clear information on availability of specialized \nthat o\ufb00er trauma healing.\n3.4.

However remote areas of the state can only boast of Primary Health Care Clinics \nwhich are ill equipped to handle basic health care challenges and so the provision of health care to \nSGBV  is lacking, given the specialized health needs of survivors.\n4.1.  Outr each and mobile clinic programme\nMobile clinics and outreaches breach the gap between the accessibility of facility-based clinic and \nthe patient, especially survivors who may need to access medical facilities with 72 hours of being \nraped. To overcome the challenges of accessibility inherent to a facility-based health care system, \nsome governments have developed ad hoc mobile clinic programmes to reach out to local \ncommunities, as it is seen as a key tool to accessing population at risk, those in the rural areas, where \nthe medical facilities are either underfunded, ill equipped, or lack quali\ufb01ed personnel. \nUnfortunately , most of the states in Nigeria do not have mobile clinics or outreaches, while the \nPrimary Health Care Centers are not well equipped, leaving citizens to seek medical attention from \nunquali\ufb01ed persons. It was reported that the challenges of access to health in Adamawa state is the \nlack of dedicated ambulances to transfer referred patients from the rural areas to the Capital, like in \nmost of the States in Nigeria.\nIn the absence of specialized clinics to handle certain cases, including SGBV , some state \ngovernment have outreach and mobile clinics, with equipped ambulances to evacuate citizens in \ncase of emer gencies. Most states, including Bauchi, Yobe and Imo State reported the availability of \nmobile clinics in the form of a well-equipped ambulance to evacuate persons where necessary . In \nBauchi state for instance, it was reported that the mobile clinic carries out outreach activities, but it \nhas some limitations, as it is not often available. In Yobe State, though there are no mobile clinics, \nthere are outreach services in some major cities/towns such as Damaturu, Potiskum, Nguru, Gashua \nand also the State Specialist hospital served as facility that provide health services, supported by the \nBritish Government and SARC. \nHowever , the case in Imo State is di\ufb00erent, as the in 2020, the government of Imo State revived the \nmobile clinic in the State. This has increased the number of citizens that access health care, \nespecially in an emer gency situation. Ambulances and medical personnel are strategically \npositioned for quick response and intervention. On 19 August 2020, the State launched the \nInnovative Mobile Health Insurance program with the Technical support from World Health \nOrganization. These actions are all geared towards coverage of a large population of citizens to \naccess health care at a\ufb00ordable rates.\nAcross the States, it was reported that survivors have access to the hospital and received treatment \nfree. The state government program on free drugs to women and children have further enhance \naccess to the clinics. \n4.2. Readiness of medical care for survivors\nIn most of the State hospitals visited during the 16 days of activism, the medical o\ufb03cers informed \nthe Commission that they are ready and willing to attend to survivors of SGBV . In some states, there \nare SARC, with the support of EU and British Council, dedicated to respond to survivors of rape and \nother GBV  cases. Most of these centers are established within the specialist hospitals or general \nhospitals at the capital, leaving the rural areas, without support as cases of  rape and other form of \ngender -based violence go unreported.\nIn Yobe State for instance, the Medical O\ufb03cer at the Specialist Hospital reported the readiness of 4.0.

Human immunode\ufb01ciency virus and other  sexually transmitted infections \nInteraction with health care providers, and some focus group discussions with women, and other \nCSO, the Commission was repeatedly informed of the high prevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and \nother infections resulting from rape. According to medical specialists, the risk of infection is indeed \nhigher in survivors of sexual violence in general, due to the increased likelihood of genital injury \nand the high undetected HIV prevalence in the society . While syphilis may be treated and cured if \ndiagnosed at an early stage, HIV infection requires the survivor to be treated with antiretroviral \nmedication on a continual basis.\n4.6. Access to reproductive health\nReproductive health care is not readily available to women and girls, as it is viewed in some parts of \nthe country as a taboo for a woman or girl to seek family planning. In the male dominated society , \nany woman who wants to assert her right to reproductive health is termed promiscuous. Some \nsociety view children as gifts from God and no woman should be an impediment to procreation. \nThis myth is spread and taken far, without paying attention to the health of the woman who carries \nthe pregnancy . Also, it is illegal to procure abortion in Nigeria and anyone found to have procured or \naided the procurement of abortion is held liable for having committed a crime of murder . The basis \nof inadequate reproductive health rights is based on some cultural norms and ideology and this \nimpedes access to reproductive health service leading to high rates of maternal and perinatal \nmortality and morbidity , high incidences of unsafe abortions and its consequences, high rates of \nvesicovaginal \ufb01stula, high contraceptive prevalence and other reproductive health challenges. \nAcross the States, while it was reported that there were available clinics o\ufb00ering reproductive \nhealth services, it is limited to contraceptives and only if the male counterpart approves, not \nminding the rights of the woman to choose. It is not available to girls, because it is seen as \u201cspoiling \nour daughters\u201d and making them promiscuous. In some states it was reported that the services are \ndiscriminatory , based on the social standing of the person seeking the services.\nUnwanted pregnancy resulting from rape is one of the main reasons leading survivors to seek \nmedical care. Women and girls who become pregnant because of rape often face the risk of being \nostracized or rejected by their families and communities, and have no opportunity of aborting the \nunwanted pregnancy , given the illegality of doing so. In the absence of a legal regime specifying \nthat abortion can be procured under circumstances of pregnancy out of rape, survivors are left to \nseek unsafe ways of procuring aborting, with its consequences of either death or damage to \nreproductive system.\n4.7.  Availability of medication and Counselling \nIt is generally a\ufb03rmed that counseling of victims of SGBV  is absolutely essential and should be \ndone as a matter of priority for survivors. The process should begin with the \ufb01rst contact with any \npartner that provides services to survivors of SGBV . Counseling for SGBV  Survivors should be \ndone by professionals in a safe, secured, protected and con\ufb01dential environment, given the state of \nthe survivors and the issues involved.  Currently , there is a great gap in providing counselling and \npsycho-social support to SGBV  survivors across Nigeria. Except for some few States which \nreported availability of robust centers for provision of services including psychosocial support, \nmost of the States reported limited services. However , in some States where there is the SARC \navailable, these provisions are provided by specialized personnel.\nAnother issue in provision of service is the lack of safe homes to provide shelter and protection to", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b78340f-f2e2-487b-9209-77fb290f758a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b78340f-f2e2-487b-9209-77fb290f758a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1265718, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "69767f71-d3df-41f6-ae1d-caf983ed5499", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1265718, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "53597d488e66f508a67d05962020926ce6c0515297a9080bb5c54572247955c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IONTA AL N \nHUMAN RIGHTS NATIONAL  \nHUMAN \nRIGHTS \nCOMMISSION\n33survivors. The only States that reported availability of safe homes are Lagos and Adamawa States. \nPlateau state reported lack of safe homes and trained professional, even among the Police personnel \nmanning the gender desk at the Police Stations and the Plateau State hospital having insu\ufb03cient \ntrained personnel to o\ufb00er psychosocial supports. Aside from the Plateau State hospital, only two \nprivately run organizations (CWEENS and Grace Gardens), within the Jos Metropolis, have trained \npersonnel and facilities to expertly handle SGBV  cases especially , in cases where the victims are \nminors. Unfortunately , these facilities are often over stretched due to the demand for the services \nthey o\ufb00er.\nAccording to the o\ufb03cers at the Family Support Hospital, Damaturu, Yobe State, the General \nHospital and four (4) SARC centers received supplies of PEP and other drugs from British Council \nfor treatment of SGBV  survivor(s) and the State government supplies drugs for free to women on \ndelivery . The Clinics also provides counselling to GBV  survivors who are identi\ufb01ed in the course of \ndiagnosis and are referred for psychosocial counselling. In Sokoto State, it was reported that there is \navailable at the Nana Khadija referral centre supported by Spotlight Initiative, at Sokoto specialist \nhospital, access to medication and counselling, given free to survivors. \nTo a very large extent, Nigeria hospitals and survivor provision centers rely on international donor \npartners, (health pooled Fund or World Bank), for essential drugs and facilities to support survivors. \nSARC established in 25 States of the Federation is supported by EU and the British Council. \nGovernment health facilities must seek additional supplies on a regular basis, from the budgetary \nallocations. \n4.8. Health worker  ratio and skills \nHealth worker ratio to survivors is not clearly established in most of the States in the Federation, as \ncases of sexual and gender -based violence apart from the ones that present with HIV infection are \ntreated as normal medical cases reported to the State Health Facilities. So, in most states where there \nis no SARC available, the ration is not available. For States with SARC, such as Yobe (Damaturu), \nreported 3 doctors among 1 male, 2 females and 2 nurses at the SARC, coordinating activities of the \ncenter , while Adamawa reported 21 skilled personnel including doctors, nurses, psychologist, and \npharmacist at the center .\nIn other to close the gap of health workers to patients, there is need for special training of those who \nattend to such cases in order to acquire the needed skills to handle such cases were raised by the \nhealth institutions.\n4.9. Social barriers/Stigmatisation\nSocial barriers created as a result of stigmatization were noted as part of the challenges inhibiting \nsurvivors from reporting violations meted out on them and seeking the available services. Stigma \nassociated with SGBV  exacerbates its physical and mental health impacts as well as the chances of \nexperiencing additional violence. \nThis is increased were the survivors are made to blame themselves for what has happened, feel that \nthey have attracted the violence and should be ashamed and their concerns are not readily identi\ufb01ed \nby the service providers or families.

Such policies include the National \nGender Policy , 2006, which seeks to promote a society that believes in inclusion, syner gizing its \npotentials without bias of gender . It also seeks to achieve the promotion of fundamental human \nrights and protect health, social, economic and the political sustenance of all citizens, in  order  to  \nachieve equitable  rapid  economic  growth. In addition, the Policy is aimed at evolving an \nevidence-based planning and governance system where human, social, \ufb01nancial, and technological  \nresources  are  e\ufb03ciently  and e\ufb00ectively  deployed  for  sustainable  development. The National \nGender Policy was endorsed in 2006 by all states in Nigeria. The policy has sixteen thematic areas \nwhich include gender -based violence, poverty and economic empowerment, education and \ntraining, health and employment and sets the objective of thirty \ufb01ve percent (35%) quota for female \nrepresentation in appointed and elected post. The policy places responsibility on the Ministry of \nWomen A\ufb00airs and Social Development to be e\ufb00ective in the states.  Unfortunately , these lofty \nideals are yet to be met as a result of paucity of funds, lack of political will etc.\nAlso, in response to the violence against women issues, there was established the National Referral \nPathway Guideline for Prevention and Response to Gender Based Violence. This facilitates \nprimary duty bearers, actors and \ufb01rst responders with information on how to respond to SGBV  \ncases and to guide survivors on where to seek assistance and enlighten them on available services at \ndi\ufb00erent referral points.

This is \nbecause violence against women and girls is viewed as violation of human rights, which is at the \ncore of all sustainable development goals. Violence against women and girls impedes progress in \nmany areas of their lives, including poverty eradication (SDG 1), attainments of zero hunger (SDG \n2); good health (SDG 3); education (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) and peace & security (SDG \n16).  Nigeria however appears to be far from achieving the SDG by 2030 including addressing the \ninsecurity in parts of the Country that perpetrates poverty , hunger , medical care, and impedes peace \nand security .\nNigeria has pledged to attain all development goals by 2030 and to achieve this, and be counted \namong the community of nations, it must, as a matter of priority , strive to achieve the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. However , with the nominal involvement of the government in public health \nsector , low budgetary allocation and lack of concrete e\ufb00orts at retaining medical personnel in the \npublic health sector , and then protracted security challenges in parts of the country , Nigeria appears \nto be o\ufb00 track in achieving the SDG by 2030, including addressing security , social and economic \nchallenges that exacerbates violence against women and girls. \nAgenda 2030 has reinforced global health as a political priority , more so, with the COVID 19 \npandemic which has a\ufb00ected the whole world and exposed the fact that the right to health is not a \nright in isolation of right to life and other rights viewed as fundamental. It has reinforced the need \nfor urgent and concerted e\ufb00orts at ensuring that global health is a means to ending poverty , \npromoting peaceful and an inclusive society . To achieve this, the Nigerian government has to \nreview its processes, through an open, inclusive, and transparent means for all the people, introduce \ngeneral health insurance, in a manner that leaves no one behind in accessing health facilities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2515, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5eab3444-c832-484e-8c3e-c749a36c553b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5eab3444-c832-484e-8c3e-c749a36c553b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1265718, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1bd8aa6d-2b7f-456e-be46-5e120357526e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1265718, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "2d5f4a3c92b3aa8644eaed0ff87f12944b02ff19b95c38d918de9464a626273c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IONTA AL N \nHUMAN RIGHTS NATIONAL  \nHUMAN \nRIGHTS \nCOMMISSION\n40The response from the government to curb the menace of violence against women and girls, the \nFederal and State Governments of Nigeria have adopted some measures, by enacting laws and \nmaking policies that aim to guard against it.

Conclusion\nFrom the activities conducted across the States including the Federal Capital Territory , it became \napparent to the Commission that violence against women and girls is still a crisis that requires multi \nstakeholder intervention. It a\ufb00ects socio-economic development and defeats the objectivity of \nequality . The act of violence against women and girls' derails progress on basic rights and freedoms. \nIt is evident from \ufb01ndings that there is still much work to be done by all stakeholders, the need for a \nresponsive partners and Government with political will is also apparent. This is evident in the fact \nthat in theory there are available laws in to curb SGBV  however , these laws and policies do not have \nthe required framework to function e\ufb00ectively and so gradually becoming dormant. The most \nsigni\ufb01cant of the laws, VAPP, is yet to be passed in most of the State. \nIt was also worrisome to the Commission that most of the institutions visited during the 16 days of \nActivism, did not have record related to SGBV , where it is present, it is not properly synchronized to \nachieve the desired outcomes. \nThe 16 days of activism conducted by the Commission has initiated a momentum within the various \nStates which many stakeholders keyed into. Hopefully , the momentum will be sustained and \ntranslated into tangible action, especially in the passage of laws and development of policies that \nensure accountability and end impunity in the \ufb01ght on violence against women and girls.\n7.3. Recommendations\nFederal Government\n1. Provide adequate facilities to the law enforcement o\ufb03cers, especially the police to respond \nto reports of SGBV\n2. Train and re-train the o\ufb03cers on intake, documenting, investigation and prosecuting SGBV  \ncases\n3. Provide adequate budgetary allocation to health to fund hospitals and provide personnel and \ndrugs for survivors\nState Governments\n1. For states that are yet to pass the VAPP law, urged to do so without further delay , as it will aid\n the enforcement of o\ufb00ences of SGBV\n2. Pass the Child Rights Law\n3. Put in place institutions that enable the handling and treatment of SGBV  cases, especially \n equipping medical personnel in State hospital with necessary skills and space to handle \n SGBV  cases\n4. Work collaboratively with CSOs/NGOs in the area of SGBV  and traditional institutions to \n outlaw harmful practices against women and girls\n5. State government should establishment the Sex O\ufb00enders Register , to act as a name and \n shame record of sex o\ufb00enders.\n6. Establishment or strengthen Family Courts in all the Local Governments in to ensure speedy \n trial of SGBV  cases\n7.

The Judiciary \nwhich is the last hope of the common man in Nigeria should be independent, and must act without fear, \nfavour or illwill. They should be seen to do justice at all times. In most societies, women and children \nare the most endangered species. Access to justice ensures that women get timely justice to redress their \nwrongs. This is because for every wrong there is a remedy hence the latin maxim ibi jus ibi remedi um. \nSection 36(6) of the constitution provides for access to justice for all citizens in Nigeria. Access to justice \npromotes the achievement of sustainable development as it promotes the participation of citizens of a \ncountry, reduces poverty, increases th e productivity of persons and strengthens the peace and \ndevelopment of nations. This article addresses violence against women, traditional harmful practices \nand discusses the legal framework for the protection of access to justice in Nigeria, and proffers \nrecommendations for the strengthening of the country\u2019s legal framework.  \n \nIntroduction    \nEvery society wrestles with the nature of justice, punishment, fairness and order. For many, the iconic \nimage of a blindfolded woman welding a set scale, or a sword has endured as a symbol around the world. \nThe concept of justice is difficult to define. In  the case of H.A Willoughsy v. International Merchant \nBank  (Nig) Ltd.1 Justice Kayo Eso of blessed memory stated that \u201cjustice as a concept is not easy to \ndefine despite postulations by great jurists from time immemorial\u2019\u2019. It is perhaps for the reason of \ndifficulty of an objective definition of justice that it has been cons idered safe to regard justice to be done \nonce it is according to law. Justice is the process through which laws and institutions resolve conflicting \nclaims and provide remedies for various forms of abuse and exploitation. Access to justice extends \nbeyond a n individual\u2019s ability to get legal representation in courts and includes the ease and extent to \nwhich people can obtain reliefs for the violation of their rights as well as the fairness and efficiency of \nsuch reliefs. This means that individuals do not ha ve access to justice when they are terrified of the \nrigours attached to the process of obtaining justice, as this affects their decision to speak out against \nabuse.  \n \nIn Edu v Odan community2, Anthony Aniagolu JSC emphasized the need for the Supreme Court to \npromote justice when he said that \u201cThe court of last resort will indeed do justice, but must do the justice \nby procedures laid down by the law and the constitution. The moment a court ceases to do justice in \naccordance with the procedures laid down for it, it ceases to be a regular court to become a kangaroo \ncourt\u201d. In Nigeria, people experie nce difficulties in accessing justice, both in civil and criminal matters, \nwhich particularly affects women and creates room for impunity and further denial of rights. The extent \nto which women access justice determines whether a nation observers the rule of law, has an effective \njudicial system and takes the human rights of its citizens seriously.3 \n \nGender Based Violence  \nGender -based violence is a phenomenon deeply rooted in gender inequality, and continue to be one of \nthe most notable human rights violations within all societies. Gender -based violence is violence directed \nagainst a person because of their gender. Both wom en and men experience gender -based violence but \nthe majority of victims are women and girls.  \n \n* Lecturer in the Faculty of Law, Rivers State University, nginene@yahoo.co.uk  \n (1987) NWLR (pt. 48)105  \n2 (1980) NWLR pt 11, 103  \n3 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 2015", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a74ae527-8beb-44ea-a786-af71327370e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a74ae527-8beb-44ea-a786-af71327370e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc4e283e-9cea-4c44-b6b9-3fcf00790b67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "41558ee023d8dbd66601e2eb297731d5a5a6e44c21f054ec3043ed6b9fcb7d65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "African Journal Vol.8  \n \n58 \n  \nThe World Bank\u2019s Inter Agency Standing Committee defined gender -based violence (GBV) as \u201cany \nharmful act that is perpetrated against a person\u2019s will and that is based on socially ascribed (gender \ndifferences between males and females. GBV leads to trauma, depression, physical injuries, suicidal \nthoughts and even death. It also affects the ability of women to care for their children as well as hinders \ntheir development which affects the overall development of the nation.  \n \nThe most common form of GBV is intimate partner violence which is defined as \u201cabuse within the home \nwith the effect of causing harm and violating the rights of its victims\u201d. Intimate partner violence is hardly \nreported and women who seek help usually turn to their family members instead of taking legal actions.  \n \nHarmful Traditional Practices  \nHarmful traditional practices constitutes another form of GBV. These are cultural based acts which \ncause harm to members of the communities that practice them. For instance, widowhood rites, where \nwomen are either forced to drink the water used to wash the ir husband\u2019s bodies, shave their heads and \nsleep besides their husband\u2019s corpses. Other harmful cultures includes female genital mutilation and \nchild marriages. A principal legislation is the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act, 2015. It \ncriminalize s harmful cultural practices like FGM and harmful widowhood practices as well as other \nforms of violence such as spousal battery, emotional, verbal and psychological abuse.  \n \nSexual Harassment at Workplace  \nSexual harassment is the unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours and other verbal or \nphysical conduct of a sexual nature when submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or \nimplicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employmen t or submission to or rejection of such \nconduct by an individual and is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or \nsuch conduct has the purpose of effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work \nperformance or creat ing an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.  \n \nUnwelcome behaviour is the critical word, unwelcome does not mean \u201cinvoluntary\u201d. A victim may \nconsent or agree to a certain conduct and actively participate in it even though it is offensive and \nobjectionable. Therefore,  sexual conduct is unwelcome whenever the person subjected to it considers it \nunwelcome. Whether the person in fact welcomed a request for a date, sex -oriented comment or joke \ndepends on all the circumstances.4 \n \nIn the case of Ejieke Maduka v Microsoft Nigeria Limited and 3 Ors5, the National Industrial Court of \nNigeria notes that sexual harassment is contrary to the provisions of section 34(1)(a)6 together with \nArticles 2 and 5 of the African Charter which recognizes respect to the dignity of persons as a human \nright and prohibits all forms of degrading treatment. Women are harassed sexually in the workplace in \nNigeria, either at the point of seeki ng for employments or as full employees. Sexual harassment in the \nworkplace involves unequal power relations between the employee and employer. The employee is \noffered some benefits for sexual relations with her supervisors, also known as quid pro quo . Another \nform involves hostile work environments where the perpetrator creates an uncomfortable and \nintimidating environment to the extent that it causes anxiety for the victims and lowers their productivity. \nSexual harassment in the workplace portrays th e ide a that women in professional settings have lesser \nstatus than men. Women surely need access to justice for the protection against sexual harassment in \nthe society.  \n \nA sexual Harassment Bill was passed by the Senate on the seventh of July 2020 and thereafter forwarded \nto the House of Representatives for deliberations. This bill sought to curb the harassment of students in \ntertiary institution and prescribes up to 14 ye ars imprisonment for various offences. The Bill has \nhowever been criticized for limiting its scope to only cover the educators, excluding support staff and \n \n4 Preventing sexual harassment ( BNA Communication  INC) SDE 1P; 73  \n5 NICN/LA/492/2012  \n6 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4341, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65f2ff28-47f1-4222-a098-8b30567650f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "65f2ff28-47f1-4222-a098-8b30567650f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7fedeb83-0ed9-497b-a63f-c687eb8d19eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "11913cde97ad9d8854fd2e1ed9744de0f9c88c7e84be4723fa361f7712142d10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "African Journal Vol.8  \n \n59 \n students in tertiary institutions. Condemnations also follow the exclusion of sexual harassment in the \nworkplace as well as other educational institutions like primary and secondary schools.  \n \nLegal Framework for the Protection of Access to Justice of Women in Nigeria  \nLaws provide a good foundation to finding solutions and deterring acts that cause any mayhem in the \nsociety. It must be noted that the enactment of laws is not enough to curb societal ill. These laws enable \nwomen to enjoy their human rights to accessing ju stice in all facets of life. Below are some of the laws \ndiscussed here under.7 \n \n(1) Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)  \nThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is supreme to all other laws and is binding on all \nauthorities and persons in Nigeria. Section 6,8 provides that the judicial powers conferred on the court \nshall extend to all matters between persons, or between government and citizen for the determination of \nthe rights and obligations of every person. The right to fair hearing of every person is guara nteed by \nsection 36,9 and it includes the right to have any question relating to the rights and obligations of any \nperson determined within a reasonable time by impartial and independent courts and tribunals. S. 36(6)10 \nprovides that people suspected of committing crimes should be given the opportunity to defend \nthemselves either in person or by their legal practitioners. Furthermore, section 42(1)11 protects Nigeria \ncitizens from administrative action of the government.  \n \nNo person shall be condemned unheard while every accused person shall be presumed innocent until \nthe contrary is proved by the state12. Pending the conclusion of trial, an accused person is entitled to \nbail. Every person charged with a criminal offence shall be informed of the details of the nature of the \noffence and be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defenc e. The suspect is \nentitled to self -defence or defence by lawyers of choice and the assistance of an interpreter if the person \ndoes not understand the language used at the trial. No person shall be tried twice for the same offence.  \n \nAccess to justice is a fundamental and basic requirement of any system of justice in granting legal rights \nto the citizens. It is clear that the spirit and the intent of the constitution is to promote good governance \nand welfare of all persons in our count ry on the principles of freedom, equality and justice. This can be \nseen in the preamble of the constitution. Therefore, any law or policy that  deviates from the promotion \nof justice to all and sundry is inconsistent  with the letter and spirit of  the cons titution.  \n \nThe constitution has made express provision for access to justice as one of the fundamental rights \nguaranteed to every individual. Section 36(1) of the constitution provides:  \n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations, including any \nquestion or determination by or against any government or authority, a \nperson shall be entitled to fair hearing within a reasonable time by a court \nor other tribunal established by la w and constituted in such manner as to \nsecure its independence and impartiality\u201d13 \nFrom the above provision, it is clear that anyone who feels he has a claim against an individual or \ngovernment department or institution can approach the law court for the determination of that claim.  \nSimilarly, S. 46(1) makes specific reference to fundamental rights. It provides thus:  \n\u201cAny person who alleges that any of the provisions of the chapter has been or likely to be contravened \nin any state in relation to him may apply to a High Court in that state for redress\u201d  \nThis gives every person the right to seek redress in a High Court located in any state where the violation \nof their fundamental right has occurred or may occur. The application of access to justice is that \n \n7 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)  \n8Ibid \n9Ibid \n10Ibid \n11Ibid \n12Ibid,  S. 36(5)  \n13  Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 ( as amended)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3436860d-8ddf-4bd2-b10a-feb951e3ea83": {"__data__": {"id_": "3436860d-8ddf-4bd2-b10a-feb951e3ea83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "726b38b6-16c4-49c3-b503-79e9cdc9fe77", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "54101f5a9e8e9e25f9851726d160f5f5c5b808f39a88766ec8a5ef2cb8b0538b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "African Journal Vol.8  \n \n60 \n everybody is given equal rights before the law, irrespective of gender, status or class. The Constitution \nthus is the major legal framework for the protection of access to justice of women in Nigeria.  \n \n(2) Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, 2015  \nThe Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act was enacted in Nigeria in order to comply with \nCEDAW\u2019s recommendations which enjoined parties to take legal measures to protect women against \ngender -based  violence. The Act is comprised of 48 sections and 9 schedules consisting of 6 forms. The \nobject of the Act is to eliminate violence of all forms in both private and public life by providing \nadequate protection and remedies for victims and punishment of of fenders. It covers most of the \nprevalent forms of viole nce in Nigeria ranging from economic, physical, psychological and sexual \nviolence such as rape. It covers violence relating to traditional practices such as circumcision or genital \nmutilation and harmful traditional practices.  \n \nThe Act also covers socio -economic and political violence as well as domestic offences such as \nabandonment of children, forceful ejection from home, spousal battery and incest. It also made provision \nfor the protection, rehabilitation and compensation for victims. Beyond domestic violence, the Act \ncovers electoral violence, offensive conduct, emotional, psychological, verbal abuse, spousal battery, \nviolence by state actors, forced isolation, separation from family and friend, stalking, harmful \nwidowhood pra ctices, incest, indecent exposure etc.  \n \nThe Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act has made adequate provisions for vulnerable persons. \nUnder the law, victims of domestic violence are at liberty to apply to a court for a protection order to \nrestrain an individual or state actor from committi ng acts of violence against them. One laudable aspect \nof the Act is the criminalization of acts that were previously not regarded as offences under Nigeria law, \nincluding harmful traditional practices, FGM,14  emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, harmful \nwidowhood practices, and abandonment of spouse, children and other dependents without sustenance15. \nPersons convicted of these offences will either be sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 2 years to \nlife imprisonment or asked to pay fines.  \n \nFurthermore, the VAPP Act expanded the definition of Rape. Section 1,16 defines rape to \u201cinclude where \na person intentionally uses any part of the body or thing to penetrate the vagina, anus or mouth of another \nperson provided the other person did not consent or the consent was not obtained by fraud or by any \nother unlawful m eans or means of threat or intimidation of any kind or by fear of harm, or by means of \nfalse and fraudulent representation as to the nature of the act or the use of any substance or addictive \ncapable of taking away the will of such person or in the case of  a married person by impersonating his \nor her spouse. By this definition, both males and females are protected against rape. Again, apart from \nthe punishment meted out to a perpetrator of rape, their victims can now be given appropriate \ncompensation, depen ding on the circumstances of the case17. A sex offender register has also been \nestablished under the Act; where persons convicted of sexual offences will be registered to prevent them \nfrom committing further assaults as well as deter prospective offenders.18 Victims of domestic violence \ncan apply for protection orders to prevent further acts of violence against such a person.19 \n \nHowever, the Act has been criticized for not mentioning clearly that violence against women is a \ndiscriminating practice and a violation of their human rights, as recommended by the United Nations \nmodel framework for legislation on Violence Against Women. Furthermore, the Act authorizes the \nNational Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP) to enforce the provisions of the \nAct.20 The NAPTIP is a specialized agency established to combat trafficking in persons through the \ntrafficking in persons (Prohibition) Law Enforcement and Administration Act of 2003.  \n \n \n14 VAPP Act 2015, S. 6  \n15  VAPP Act 205, S. 16  \n16 VAPP Act, 2015  \n17 VAPP Act 2015, S. 38(1)  \n18  VAPP Act 2015, S. 42  \n19Ibid,  S. 38(1) (c) (iii)  \n20  VAPP Act, 2015, S. 44", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4386, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cb1b9f7-c32e-4b85-afe6-d2f2c989f770": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cb1b9f7-c32e-4b85-afe6-d2f2c989f770", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ada0654-2405-4dee-a337-763d2568b228", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 - PROJECTS\\vault\\data\\THE+LEGAL+FRAMEWORK+FOR+THE+PROMOTION+OF+ACCESS+TO++JUSTICE+FOR+WOMEN+IN+NIGERIA.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 322696, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "4b02b3864151570f4644b205efaec8015191b64a622a4b5232aa099d8bb35fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "African Journal Vol.8  \n \n61 \n Despite the laudable provisions of the Act, the provisions of Section 27(A) and 46 of the Act poses a \nmajor setback to the elimination a violence in our society. Section 46 of the Act has limited the \napplication of the Act to the Federal Capital Territory,  Abuja. This provision shuts out other parts of the \nfederation from the benefits of this laudable Act. Section 27(a) empowers only the High Courts of the \nFederal Capital Territory, Abuja to grant applications brought under the Act. The combined effect of \nthese provisions is that the Federal High Court is excluded from the operation of the Act.  \n \n3. Legal Aid Council  \nIn order to facilitate access to justice by indigent citizens, the government has established some \ninstitutions to provide free legal services. Thus, pursuant to the Legal Aid Act, the legal Aid council is \nrequired to assign legal practitioners to appear f or indigent citizens charged with any offence in any \ncriminal court in the country. If such indigent persons have civil claims the council will assign lawyers \nto handle them.  \n \nEach of the state government has created the office of the public defenders to provide legal services to \nwomen, children and other vulnerable members of the society. These are non -governmental \norganizations that are involved in defending the rights of women and other vulnerable people in the \nsociety through such NGO\u2019s laws and policies which discriminate against women have been declared \nunconstitutional while a few others have been repealed by the National Assembly.  \n \n4. Sexual Offences Bill 2013  \nThe Sexual Offences Bill was introduced and sponsored by Senator Anyanwu (a female legislator). The \nNigeria Senate passed the Sexual Offences Bill in 2015. The Bill is modelled after the Kenyan Sexual \nOffences Act, No. 3 of 2006. Both the Nigerian and Keny an laws are based on the Sexual Offences Act \n2003 of the United Kingdom (UK).21 \n \nHowever, due to misconceptions and controversies concerning some provisions of the bill (for example \nthe age of consenting the bill is yet to be assented to by the president of Nigeria). SOB contains \nprovisions on stalking, cultural and religious practices  that are discriminating against women and sexual \nharassment amongst others. The bill repeals the sexual assault provisions of the Criminal Code Act. It \nrepeals sections 21, 29 and 30 of the Criminal Code which covers sexual offences and gives a more \ncogen t definition of rape than the one stated in the VAPP Act. The Bill also regulates new sexual \noffences including indecent exposure (Clause 22), gang rape (Clause 9), child pornography (Clause 30), \nincest (Clause 18) and non -disclosure of conviction of sexua l offences (Clause 36), Clause 31 protects \nvulnerable witnesses which include the alleged victim, a child or a person with mental disabilities. The \nalternative measures to giving testimony in court provided by sub -section 4 will improve the access to \njustice of women who would otherwise have been reluctant to testify in court. Clause 35(4) provides \nthat the cost of medical treatment or professional counseling of a victim of a sexual offence shall be \ntaken up by the state.22 \n \nAlso, it has been stated that the definition of rape in the sexual offences Bill is clearer than the provisions \nin the VAPP Act. Section 2(1)(a) provides that rape is where a person intentionally and unhappily \ncommits an act which causes penetration by or of the victim with his or her own genital organ. Section \n5023 defines genital organ to include the anus and the breast. In effect \u201crape is limited to penetration of \nthe vagina and the anus with the penis\u201d.  \n \nThe Sexual offences Bill has been applauded for its ability to promote the rights of women in addition \nto improving the criminal justice system in Nigeria. However, the Bill has been condemned for being a \nreplica of the Kenyan Sexual Offence Act.  \n \n \n \n21  O.

The bill was first introduced in 2002, but did not \npass because of opposition from the Supreme Council for Sharia. The Act was officially passed into law \nin 2013 by former President Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as the Children Right Act 2003. In large par t \nbecause of the media pressure that national stakeholders and international organizations put on the \nNational Assembly.  \n \nChild\u2019s Right Act (2003) is the law that guarantees the rights of all children in Nigeria both male and \nfemales. A child as defined by the Act is any person under the age of 18. The Act mandates that when a \nchild is concerned their best interest is to take  precedent. It goes on to state that the parent or legal \nguardian is obligated to fulfill the duty to give the child basic protection. It specifies that the Article iv \nof Nigeria\u2019s constitution and any other federal law which deals with fundamental right s hould be seen \nas being part of the Act24. \n \nThe Act discusses the ways in which a child shall be protected. These include protection from child \nmarriage as well as the punishments for the act to the adult parties involved, other protections include: \nnot being harmed (including being marked with tatt oos) or from sexual violence, being shielded from \nexploitative labour, or being enlisted in any military operation. It also lists the reasons when a child \nassessment order may be sought as well as the reasons and duration which emergency protection orders \nshall be given to the child. It is also made clear the obligations of a state government when it is disclosed \nto that institution that a child is being harmed. It also lists the duration when emergency protection orders \nshall be given to a child. It also m ade clear the obligations of a state government when it is disclosed to \nthe institution that a child is being harmed. It also indicates the circumstances in which a child shall be \nbrought to court in order to determine if they need protection. This part al so stipulates the type of person \nwho shall be allowed to make such a decision using the guidelines detailed in this section.  \n \n6. Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015  \nThe Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 is divided into 48 parts with 495 sections. It Merges \nthe two principal legislation, the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA)25 and the Criminal Procedure Code \n(CPC)26. Thus, the Act repealed the CPA, CPC and the Administration of Criminal Justice Act27.  \n \nSubstantially, the provisions of the Act preserved the existing criminal procedure systems, but it \nintroduces innovative provisions that could enhance the efficiency of the justice system. The Act adopts \na more acceptable trend used in the Evidence Act 2011, where persons standing trial for criminal \noffences are not described as \u201caccused persons but as defendants\u201d. The provisions of the Act apply to \ncriminal trials for any offences established by an Act of the National Assembly and other offences \npunishable in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. However, it does not apply to a court martial.28 \n \nThe objective of the Act is captured in section 1 which read thus: \u201cThe purpose of this Act is to ensure \nthat the system of administration of criminal justice in Nigeria promotes efficient management of \ncriminal justice institutions, speedy dispensation of  justice, protection of the society from crime and \nprotection of the rights and interests of the suspects, the defendant, and the victim\u201d. The purpose of the \nAct as captured above is a deliberate shift from punishment as the main goal of our criminal justi ce to \nrestorative justice which pays more attention to the needs of the society, the victims, vulnerable persons \nand the rights and interest of a defendant.  \n \nA laudable innovation in the Act is the right of women to stand as sureties.

This provision is in line \nwith the Constitution and the Convention on the Elimination Against Women (CEDAW) which has \nbeen ratified by Nigeria.  \n \n7. Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill 2019  \nThe GOE bill was severally rejected by the National Assembly, first in 2006, then in 2010 and 2015. In \n2019, a new Bill titled \u2018Gender and Equal Opportunities (GEO) Bill 2019 was re -introduced, having \naddressed some of the initial concerns highlighted by t he senators. The bill seeks to give effect to chapter \nII and IV of the CFRN, which contains fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy \nand the fundamental human rights, respectively, in addition to certain provisions of CEDAW and the \nprotocol to the African Charter on the rights of Woman in Africa (Maputo Protocol). The GOE promotes \naccess to justice for women by stating in Clause 316(2) that women are to be treated \u2018equally with men \nin all stages of proceedings in courts and tribunals. \u201d Furthermore, the Bill prohibits discrimination \nagainst women in political and public life (Clause 6), employment (Clause 8), health (Clause 10) as well \nas discrimination based on age, marital status and disability (Clause 5). Socio -cultural practices whi ch \npromote discrimination as a result of gender stereotypes and prejudices are to be modified. By virtue of \nclause 2 of the Bill, the enactment of the GEO Bill will invalidate existing laws, regulations customs or \npractices which discriminate against women . The Bill is to be implemented by the National Human \nRights Commission as provided by clause 15. The GOE is a laudable bill which if passed, will actively \npromote equality and empower women.  \n \nConclusion  \nMany women in Nigeria are deprived of justice, mainly in the procedural aspects of getting remedies to \ntheir grievances as well as the denial of imminent needs and rights which should be enjoyed by all \ncitizens. These women are victims of domestic violence , rape, gender stereotypes, land deprivation and \nharmful cultures. Accessing justice in Nigeria is quite cumbersome and thorny. Many women experience \nchallenges in obtaining remedies which in turn leads to depression, deaths, violence, failed relationships  \nand less confidence in the justice system. Access to justice will strengthen the rule of law and promote \npeace. The Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill 2019 and the Sexual Offences Bill 2013 if passed into \nlaw will go a long way to curb discriminating pra ctices and curb sexual offences in the workplace.  \n \nRecommendations  \n1. The National Assembly should pass into law the Sexual Offences Bill 2013 and The Gender and \nEqual Opportunities Bill 2019.  \n2. The Child\u2019s Rights Act 2003 should be domesticated in all the states of the Federation.  \n3. The application of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act, 2015 should not only be \nlimited to the Federal Capital Territory. Not all the states have domesticated the VAPP Act. All \nstates as a matter of urgency should immediately domesticate it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3145, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c83e9b9-ecdc-457f-9f34-684a2ab69565": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c83e9b9-ecdc-457f-9f34-684a2ab69565", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Violence-Against-Persons-Prohibition-Act-2015-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\0 -
