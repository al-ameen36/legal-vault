Business.\nOur Mission\nImprove people\u2019s lives with \nthe world\u2019s best transportation.Overview\nLyft,\n Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.\nWe\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\n change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\n in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft\n Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\ned period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\n marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs. In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\n have made focused and substantial  investments  in support of our mission. For example,  to continually  launch new innovations on our platform,  we haveinvested\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\nader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4647, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcff55eb-4b0b-4333-881a-69836bb4740e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcff55eb-4b0b-4333-881a-69836bb4740e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1d3ddfe-b4de-46fe-8e67-dd92940ee2c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "3eb77c90be9f0736e87af6434a99cc894c337f3e8518ecc7798c11d6fea949ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1538f767-01e3-4f95-88bc-a6bd881f0a66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "980c136f5d7819a50ee4b89ed735f854de0b58d4b48a07c22b303966bdab923e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the\n impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto\n be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich\n may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor\n recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe\n office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\nFor\n more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

Continuous criminal  monitoring  allows us to quickly deactivate  drivers with disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We also checkdriving records throughout the y\near to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\u2022\nMandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These\n programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and \nreporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\u2022\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If  a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\n\u2022\nHidden contact information and ride history. The  Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, incl\nuding real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not ableto see a rider\u2019s drop-of\nf location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver\n who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never bematched with that individu\nal again through the app.In 2021,\n we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which ar\ne statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips\n in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft \nride as safe as we possibly can.Government Regulation\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately\n 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineer\ning, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We\n believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees\n reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male\n and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8%\n Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.\nWe\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone\n Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe \nrecruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of\n the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive yea\nr to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019\n annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent\n demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors\n not accounted for in the statistical models we used.

Our vision is to rebuildcities\n around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother\n step in the shift from personal car ownership, we\u2019ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition \nto perks for car rentals.We\n launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople\n as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a \u201cresilient street corridor\u201d might look like in cities where Lyftoperates\n micromobility  services.  It  also  investigated  the  impact  of  street  design  on  key  metrics  around  vehicle  miles  traveled,  socioeconomic  demographics  and  GHGemissions.\n12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3425, "end_char_idx": 5694, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c11abce9-dc9d-4ef6-9797-379727c4a54f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c11abce9-dc9d-4ef6-9797-379727c4a54f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4683342e-98e4-411e-b64d-2c3d9cb63cd9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "de61c9a2a64b22430e6bf3199fb85f9bfb210e9fc5fe11bc9784d9f1bb0773b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.By\n working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasolineconsumption\n by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia\n Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs\n will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and pe\nrsonal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it\u2019s good for people \u2013 riders,drivers, and the communit\nies they serve.Social\nWe\n approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect\n and a common objective of improving people\u2019s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we\u2019re working to enable access to affordable,reliable\n transportation for all \u2014 no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding\n transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, b\nike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\n\u2022\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\n\u2022\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\n\u2022\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\nities of color.In\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or sh\nare where they are going or why.Corporate Governance\nOur\n board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe\n utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nCorporate Information\nWe\n were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset\n life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods,\n and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized\n over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.  Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses\n could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter \nthem, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As\n our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations\n will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competit\nion, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel\n and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the \nfuture and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competit\nion and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices\n and offerings.

For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.

If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment\n model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions.

Any of the foregoing risks couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle.

Moreover, successful  litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification  of drivers on our platform  as employees  could reduce the availablesupply\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\n or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\n negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, couldadversely\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\n of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  and again suspended rentals  of scooters from December  2020through February 2021 an\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual\n region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto\n successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe\n negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased\n number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or inciden\nts involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.We design and\n contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand\n scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable\n to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. Wealso\n design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  andmanufacturing services.\nThe\n supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or\n key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditio\nns, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affect\ned and could continue to affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing an\nd operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles.

Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations.Our\n Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market \nvalues, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For\n the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress\n Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment\n to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat\n any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements,\n despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or\n Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises\n such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles\n in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has in\ncreased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The\n costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party\n resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue\n of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected\n the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly\n seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in\n residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate\n those vehicles at a more accelerated rate.

For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand\n miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our pa\nrtner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Shared and\n Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With\n a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider\u2019s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along\n a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur industry is\n relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States an\nd Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For\n example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our\n ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The\n City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for\n our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich\n we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally,\n particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents.

We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative\n actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California\u2019s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including\n those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.\n We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey.

From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions.

Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation.

For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or no\nt, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In\n addition, we regularly include arbitration  provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform.  These provisions are intended tostreamline\n the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration\n may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain\n risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand,\n we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litiga\ntion costs and exposure.

For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir\n indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures\n to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe\n S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand\n temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of its  indices;  however,  in October  2018, MSCI announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal\n voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital\n structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively\n track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on thevaluations\n of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat\n are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake\n similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude\n investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform.

The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain.

We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\n operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated\n statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liabil\nity InsuranceOn\n April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\u201cReinsurance\n Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace\n as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date.

An Active Rider is identified bya\n unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\n as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\nible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\n ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\n fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide.

This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to pro\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\n price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.\n We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\n consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract existsbetween\n the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\n behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\n\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\nd to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\n the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn\n a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to \na rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We\n recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the complet\nion of the ride.We\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\nate the fair value of goods or services received.In\n some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides\n for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace.

Revenue generated from Flexdriveand\n Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we c\nlassify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance Reserves\nWe\n utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure\n costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate\n law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet\n reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona\n quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss\n development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.\nInsurance\n claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions\n based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic\n and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from\n previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve\n that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately\n be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We\n continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and e\nconomic environment evolves.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based comp\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).\nWe\n estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel.\n The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.

We  believeContribution\n and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as r\nevenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as r\nevenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\u2022\namortization of int angible assets;\u2022\nstock-based compensation exp ense;\u2022\npayroll tax expense rel ated to stock-based compensation;\u2022\nchanges to the liabilities f or insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022\ntransaction costs related to  certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\u2022\nrestructuring charges, if any.For more information about \ncost of revenue, see the section titled \u201cComponents of Results of Operations\u2014Cost of Revenue.\u201dContribution Margin is calcu\nlated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We\n record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment\n even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million\n for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe\n prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod\n changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including\n the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust\n the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution iscalculated\n by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies\n from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  periodresults.\nDuring the\n second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October1,\n 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021.

When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would\n be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod\n of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of thedeferral\n will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance\n Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod\n to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including\n any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance\n Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove\n over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges\n to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent\n period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date\n back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated\n to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation\n of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.\n As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.\nWe\n had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges\n resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe\n preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets\n and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring\n the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected\n future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from \nother sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3306, "end_char_idx": 5617, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe702044-27e2-452e-b63b-3687044bd4d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe702044-27e2-452e-b63b-3687044bd4d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6029ae6-f737-43c2-b4df-dd48607fe8ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "76a070c8611e677bdf90ad3745a8e85985838fe227d8c80aa704b826142ccef7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland\n identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.\nBeginning\n in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.\n The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\n headcount reductions in 2020.

These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\n on the consolidated  financial  statements  as soon as they become known. Actual  results could differ  from those estimates  and any such differences  may bematerial to the Company'\ns financial statements.Segment Information\nOperating\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\n Decision  Maker  (\u201cCODM\u201d)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company\u2019s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\n is  the Company\u2019s  CODM. The  CODM reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\nThe\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\n mobile-based applications.

The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\n transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.\nAs\n the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\n is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\n transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\n ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.\nThe\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent v\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.\nDue\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenuegenerated\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over th\ne rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe\n Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider\u2019s authorized payment method.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4884, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dffb9606-767e-464b-af4a-0fcef933fb8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dffb9606-767e-464b-af4a-0fcef933fb8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27d5b67a-9788-4869-a5ef-f66f08a6aedc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "1901bc74926dbfa90f26ce9bb4e80caf61b7a6e2b5179a943bf448b620c70666", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc5c5bf5-36fb-427e-b6c8-6b349bc34c16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "4c9999278b83294bd5010f7388176a1b72a373ebf59de8a7ee222afa4e7cbbf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable.

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\n receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\n Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The write-offs were immaterial  for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the allowance  for credit losses for the year endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\nIncentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while riders,  Light Vehicle  riders and Lyft Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or discounted  rides  under such incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.

The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.

During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs.

Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded to sales and marketing  expense.

The expected term of the ESPPpurchase\n rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic\n company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights\n using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies.

TheCompany recognizes compensat\nion expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PS\nUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined\n based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.

The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration\n Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for \nthe RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service period\ns. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condit\nion only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based\n compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessar\ny, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income Taxes\nThe\n Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe\n estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.

The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\nolidated statements of operationsas\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\n recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.

Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\n values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.\nLight Vehicle Fleet\nThe\n Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 3\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\n million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\n service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.

Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents,\n such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the\n period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease\n revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual\n value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present \nand estimated future market conditions.Lessee\nThe\n Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe\n Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand\n lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat\n the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo\n so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease lia\nbilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The\n Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments\n based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collat\neralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Compan\ny\u2019s lease liability calculation.

Such events and changes  may include:  significant  changes in performancerelative\n to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company measuresrecoverability\n of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If thecarrying value\n of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.

The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform\n and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform\n the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively. For the yea\nr ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance Reserves\nThe\n Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underi\nnsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder\n state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims  may take years to completely settle,  and the Company has limited  historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational  history, theCompany\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.

The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheldbasis,\n meaning  that  funds  are  withheld  by  PVIC  from  the  insurance  premium  owed  to  DARAG in  order  to  pay  future  reinsurance  claims  on  DARAG\u2019s  behalf.  Uponconsummation\n of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurancerecoverable\n has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued andother current liabilities on\n the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities\n is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, thebalance\n of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.The\n Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3178, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e56c9db-daa5-4b65-90fc-6fbd31dc94d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e56c9db-daa5-4b65-90fc-6fbd31dc94d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4623aea8-d6cf-4074-8bb1-7556fcf06206", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "3d3ccd70ead4745e408b256fc7376e3b2268414a6fc390e327ecacf2147b8026", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8f08f0e-1066-493f-ae0d-4baa1d68ee8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "0b511d5644fcba669375371e937e74fe40c1501e411e9dac4e73f83e657d6c16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities\n is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation.

Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements ofoperations.\nIn March 2020, the Company purchased a\n non-marketable equity security for total cash consideration of $10.0 million that is classified in other investments on theconsolidated balance she\nets.In\n June 2021, the Company received an investment in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily determinable market valueas part of licensing and data\n access agreements. The investment had a carrying value of $64.0 million and is categorized as Level 3. The Company does not have significantinfluence\n over this privately-held company and has elected to measure this investment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on theconsolidated balance she\net. As of December 31, 2021, there were no remeasurement adjustments related to this non-marketable equity security.At\n December  31,  2021,  there  were  $80.4  million  of  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  non-recurring  basis  within  other  investments  on  theconsolidated balance she\nets.8. Leases\nReal Estate Operating Leases\nThe\n Company leases real estate property at approximately 81 locations of which all leases have commenced as of December 31, 2021. These leases are classifiedas operating leases. As of Dece\nmber 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary from one month to eight years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the leaseterm\n for  periods  varying  from  two  months  to  ten  years.  These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany\n will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe\n fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted \nfor as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive Program\nThe\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases areclassified\n as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms varybetween one month to three ye\nars. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated tothe respective leas\ne component.104", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3290, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "275f7323-4d59-49e2-be13-2708f024b328": {"__data__": {"id_": "275f7323-4d59-49e2-be13-2708f024b328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e265fd62-13b5-45ad-8cda-c7a8664f7a52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "77bc904af19c0fe4530c820aa218478bea1ac7c5511c3eb4f868fd2ea5ba8019", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Lease Position as of December 31, 2021The\n table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms andpercentages):\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020 Operating Leases\nAssets\nOperating lease right-o\nf-use assets$ 223,412 $ 275,756 Liabilities\nOperating lease liabi\nlities, current$ 53,765 $ 49,291 Operating lease liabi\nlities, non-current210,232 265,803 Total operating lease liabilities\n$ 263,997 $ 315,094 Finance Leases\nAssets\nFinance lease right-of\n-use assets$ 26,802 $ 28,108 Liabilities\nFinance lease liabil\nities, current13,556 20,795 Finance lease liabil\nities, non-current14,242 6,593 Total finance lease liabilities\n$ 27,798 $ 27,388 Weighted-average remaining lease term\n (years)Operating leases\n5.6 6.3 Finance leases\n2.2 1.5 Weighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases\n6.3 %6.4 %Finance leases\n2.8 %4.7 %_______________\n(1)\nThis  balance  is  included  within  property and  equipment,  net  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  was primarily  related  to  leases  acquired  in  the  Flexdrive  transaction.

It is not possible to determine themaximum\n potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved \nin each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved \nin, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary\n course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense\n related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,\n or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public di\nsclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\n of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis\n reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies.

The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\n material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.\n The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.

The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal\n court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand\n overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26,\n 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint\n on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer\n but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion\n to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass\n action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part an\nd denied in part that motion.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax asse\nts such that a valuation allowance has been recorded.

The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue\n to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change lim\nitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The\n Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state incom\ne tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The\n Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earning\ns outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to \nthe participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The\n Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand\n penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated\n statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of conso\nlidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our\n management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as\n of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations\n of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\nThe\n effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public ac\ncounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere\n were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange\n Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including\n our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all\n errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance\n that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be consider\ned relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and inst\nances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because\n of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the\n controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and\n there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause\n of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to e\nrror or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C.

Further, the Company\nagrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment opportunity Employee may have\nprior to Employee or Employee\u2019s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\n(c) \nBreach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee\u2019s attorney, or Employee\u2019saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\ndisclosure of such information on the Company\u2019s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee\u2019s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable. Nothing herein shall\nlimit or restrict any other remedies available to the Company, at law or in equity, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any\nobligations under this Agreement.    \n13.\nCooperation .  Following the Separation Date, Employee also agrees to cooperate with the Company in regard to the transition of thebusiness matters handled by Employee on behalf of the Company. Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the\ndefense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company, or in\nany investigation or review that may be performed by the Company or any governmental authority, which relate in any way to events or occurrences\nthat transpired while Employee was employed by the Company or about which Employee may have knowledge. Employee\u2019s cooperation in\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company\u2019s counsel to\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n14.\nNon-Disparagement . The Parties agree that they will not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the Company or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or media, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social\nmedia, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the\npersonal or business reputation of the Parties. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Parties from testifying truthfully in any valid judicial or\ngovernment agency proceeding.\n15.\nArbitration .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4975, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12b57431-63c7-452d-a9a1-89dfaef5487b": {"__data__": {"id_": "12b57431-63c7-452d-a9a1-89dfaef5487b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9f06e27-72f4-4a44-be32-d8fd124c5969", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "6d6f8f3601458a21e1b03bb226809679a1da05c91d6f9a11858fada17a18fef6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6dd1433c-7fe0-4834-90a5-9917e2438db3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10k\\lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-02"}, "hash": "5ceb664cfb60be3aa723fe185639a690207a4bfc2f83e980e60b1eb4d2035b36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n14.\nNon-Disparagement .
